"Might take a while to get my meds, what can I do? Hello. So it’s been a while since I posted on here.
It’s been a while since I’ve been able to get my meds. A mixture of Not being able to see my doctor/ refills being denied because I need to see him for a checkup.

I have a weird work schedule and his appointments are on days where I can’t make it (I work mid shift, 5 days a week). I got an appointment with him but it’s not till April 11.

I’m kind of struggling. Mainly I’m at work and if feels like I’m There but I’m not there. I’m on edge from the stress of work and school and every few minutes I feel like crying and screaming at people because recently, I feel like people are acting stupid for no reason. It’s just little things that are annoying me and It’s just so stressful.

What can I do to make it until April 11? I’m not in a crisis or anything but I just need advice, if that’s alright?

anxiety over leg numbness so i've had crippling anxiety/health anxiety for 2 years now. it's been such a torture in my life and i still havent gone to see a therapist (mostly financial reasons). but anyway two nights ago my left leg started feeling restless while i was lying in bed and i didn't think much of it and went to bed with no problem. i woke up forgetting about it until i remembered and the feeling came back even worse. it feels like how your limbs feel after they fall asleep and you wake them up - slightly numb and tingly and sometimes it feels kinda like how your legs burn after you exercise. this has been going on for two days and it's caused me so much panic because i automatically think its DVT. it was so bad that last night i had the worst panic attack i've ever had and i legitimately could not breathe. i took a xanax and i could breathe again and went to sleep but i've been dealing with it all day and my breathing has been hay wire today which is especially great since DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism which is shortness of breath so lol.... i'm going to the doctor tomorrow but i'm scared as hell. i'm trying to convince myself it's just a pinched nerve but it's so hard. i really hate living like this because i'm not even living at all.,Anxiety
"Inhalated AC/refrigerant chemicals Today, I was in sitting in a lounge area of a building at my university for about 10 minutes. All of a sudden, someone (who happens to be the professor of a class I'm in) walks by and asks ""Does it smell like burning plastic in here to anyone else?"". I took a whiff, and lo and behold, there was a *very* strong odor. A repair man eventually determined the problem to be that the HVAC system was leaking fluids into the ventilation. I left the building soon after the professor made his remarks, but I did return briefly a couple times to see if it had gotten better and to retrieve the laptop I left there.

"I'm a lot scared about my mom's lower leg pain Hi! First of all, I made a second account to talk about these personal issues, I use my personal account (which has my real name) for a lot of public things and didn't feel comfortable in sharing those personal issues there.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom had breast cancer six years ago, and treated it successfully, doing chemo and radiotherapy. Fortunately, it was diagnosed very early. She is totally cured now, and constantly monitors her breast and

 thyroid (which she had some benign cysts). She is 60 and doesn't smoke or drink at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, she removed a dot on her face. The biopsy returned Basal Cell Carcinoma, but with no spread on close lymphs. The dermatologist said it was nothing to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday she said she had been felling pain around the tibia for about a year and half. It's a pain she feels deep, that comes for some time (like a week), then disappear for some months, then comes back. It doesn't seem to be affected by exercise, but hurts at night. While she was pressing the region to show me where it was, she said she could feel it hurt a little, even if, at that moment, it wasn't hurting the way it used to. There is no swelling at all, and she said it never was. She also said the pain is the same since it begun. 

&amp;#x200B;

And she had been having some cramps a while ago, the doctors said it could be a neuropaty caused by the medications she took, like tamoxifen. She also said these cramps usually stops when this pain begins.

&amp;#x200B;

She said she's worried about it being a bone metastasis from the breast cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I know, it's extremely unlikely that a metastasis from a cancer she treated back in 2013 (and which, in that time, had no secondary tumor detected) could only appear now. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm extremely worried about other cancer possibilities. Like a primary bone cancer, or a secondary cancer from a hidden tumor that originated in other part of the body.

&amp;#x200B;

The rational part of me says it's probably neuropaty, or even some other symptom caused maybe by her age, and if that pain was bone cancer, she probably would be gone now, or at least the pain would have gotten worse after all this time, or even some swelling would have appeared.

&amp;#x200B;

But the other part (the same that worried about me having ALS because of some twitches) says it could be cancer. She has an appointment with the same doctor that treated her cancer on Monday, but, until then, I can't help but be terrified about this possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had any similar experience? Is the rational part of me probably right once again?",Anxiety
"Scared of brain amoeba Exactly one year ago I was in New Zealand where they have these geothermal pools which have a brain eating amoeba in them, which is why you shouldn't inhale that water. I didn't go into one of those but I did go into a normal hot tub and scraped my knee doing so. And I sat there for a minute before realising that it was actually bleeding so I went up and cleaned the wound and put a band aid on. Then I sat back in but didn't put my knee back in. Lately I have been freaking out over this because I have been thinking a lot about health related things. I have heard that if you do get infected you will notice the symptoms really quickly but since it's been a year I should be in the clear, right?",Anxiety

"Dry Skin This might be better suited for r/anxiety in general, but since my anxiety seems to be health anxiety I figured I'd start here.  As a background, I've never had an anxiety/stress issue prior to September, but Labor Day weekend I had what I now know was a panic attack that sent me to the ER.  Since then I've been convinced of heart disease, brain tumor, diabetes and have been under constant stress the entire time with every single thought it seems being dedicated to why I feel the way I do.  MRI, ultrasounds, EKG, stress test, blood work all comes back clean and my doctor just tells me it's stress/anxiety.

The last few weeks I have had ridiculously dry skin which I have never had before.  I saw my doctor last week and again he said it's just stress and none of my tests have been out of the ordinary to suggest otherwise.

"For anyone struggling with fairly severe anxiety episodes - I highly recommend DBT distress tolerance skills. I recently started DBT after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me, and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions (like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way) has been the most life changing thing I've learned. I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people, but [here is a link](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577d2ce937c58194f7d39816/t/60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa19/1623714139969/dbt_skills_training_handouts_and_worksheets_-_linehan_marsha_srg_.pdf) to the PDF my group uses. The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods, and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you. My personal favorite is the TIP acronym - cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face, intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute, paced breathing or breath work (sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can), all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic. Just thought I'd share if anyone is looking for ideas. Love you all &lt;3",Anxiety

"How did you overcome severe gym anxiety? Hello! I'm a gym newbie here, and I've been *really* struggling with going to the gym. 
I have no excuses anymore. I've been telling myself that once I move closer to a gym, once I get a good daily routine in, once I get a job that starts later, so on and so forth... well the stars aligned and I got a gym membership! No more excuses.

Except I've got some sort of gymphobia. I have always felt this way, even went a couple times as a teenager with my dad. I was freaked out then, too.

I went once with my boyfriend right after I got the membership and I wanted to cry the ENTIRE TIME. I was SO self-conscious, to the point it affected my movements. I wasn't focusing on lifting, I was focusing on being quiet, who could see me, how light my weights were, etc. I stared at the clock, couldn't talk louder than a whisper, clung to his side... It was a massive relief to leave and I subconsciously let out a huge sigh the minute the door shut behind us.

Tried going just to treadmill the other day, walked in and went straight to the bathroom because I was so ANXIOUS! There was only one treadmill being used but I was so worried he'd see me trying to figure it out. I got so shakey and almost started crying again so I left the bathroom and went straight home. 

I know for the sake of my mental health I need to overcome this, even if I find out the gym just isn't for me. This is absolutely my anxiety, particularly social anxiety and body dysphoria. What makes me anxious -

- being near other people working out (?!?!)

- seeing my reflection in the mirror

- using light weights (THEY ARE ALL LIGHT so I am just constantly anxious lmao)

- how long it takes me to set up/figure out a machine

- maybe someone else needs what I have and they are annoyed with me

- someone else using what I want and not know what to sub

- anyone talking to me in any capacity lmao

- my form (I'm new so logically I know it'll be incorrect but other people may judge me)

I'm tempted to shell out money for a personal trainer and a therapist. I'm sick of my anxiety and my body as it is, but I wanted to hear yalls advice.

Since this has been causing me so much anxiety forever, and it directly relates to my body dysphoria and anxiety, I feel like overcoming this is going to be a HUGE breakthrough for my mental health. I'd really appreciate your insight.Thank you!",Anxiety
"Possibly letting anxiety get to me? I am the type of poster that you will hate. I'm fully aware that I am 90% of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety, it's been my MO for awhile.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said “you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in”.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site: https://www.stdcheck.com/hiv-rna-test.php

"Trying a new way of thinking. My day normally looks something like this...
Oh man I'm dizzy. I wonder what that means. Any my left arm is weak. Is that a heart attack? Maybe a symptom of a small heart attack? Where did I get that bruse on my knee? Is that a sign of a blood clot? Should I go to the doctor again? Last time he told me to stop worrying about stuff like this. Is that a lump I'm the back of my head? Maybe that's what's causing my head ache... But what is the lump is another sign of a problem? Should I start documenting this? The doctor thinks I'm crazy but if I have all the symptoms with the times I had them he could surly run more tests. A friend I knew died for a blood clot that the doctors missed maybe my doctor missed something... etc

Recently, I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.

So I'm going to try that method. ""Oh I guess I have a headache today"". And try to leave it at that. If it lasts a week, all the  talk to my doctor.

"HA and a Palm Tree lead me to urgent care To preface, I just discovered this sub and WOW, I can’t believe there’s so many others who struggle with the same issues I do. I’ve struggled with HA since I was about 14 (I’m 24 now), and I go through periods of time where I’m fine, and then I’ll hit a rough couple of weeks that leave me absolutely crippled. 

So, couple of weeks ago (after many years of worry, I am a former smoker) I finally got the reassurance that I did not have lung cancer due to shortness of breath. Following that positive news I thought to myself “okay great, finally my HA will calm down.” That was short lived. A couple of days ago I was attempting to clean palm tree debris and got stuck by a leaf/thorn. Naturally it lead me to google it because it got slightly swollen and I convinced myself I had a serious infection and Plant Thorn Arthritis (Thanks Google) So off to the urgent care I went, they laughed at me when I demanded a Tetnus shot and gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way. 

I still can’t stop thinking about how I might have to get surgery to remove plant debris, it’s been consuming every thought of mine even though the swelling has gone down. In other news, I’ve had a slight tenderness in my thigh for a few months and my googling has lead me to believe I have a DVT. I’m freaking out and scheduled another doctor’s appointment for Monday.... 

I luckily have a very supportive SO that recognizes when I’m on my bad weeks with HA and is my safe person. It just sucks so much, we have so much planned the next few weeks and all I can focus on is my impending death.

:Last night, I had a weird sensation in the left side of my head, above the ear. It felt like something was throbbing or pulsating inside my head. It was never painful and it would go away for a few minutes before coming back. I felt it until I went to sleep (where I thought something was going to happen to me in the middle of the night or I would die in my sleep.)


It doesn't help that right now, my current paranoia is a brain tumor or a unruptured aneurysm. Earlier this week I had a headache above my left eye around my eyebrow but that went away after a few hours. I've been incredibly anxious about that side of my head.

"So anxious I literally just ran out of the dentists office Basically title.

A couple months ago I had a consultation to get a few teeth ""deep cleaned"" and two small cavities. No big deal for normal people, but I really dislike needles and put off going back.

Today I go back and they insist on doing the deep cleaning of the whole mouth for $500, while saying it doesn't look bad on X-rays so the insurance company probably won't cover it. When I said I can't afford that, the hygienist basically scolded me and went to get the dentist.

"HA Hopelessness I have had health related anxiety issues for the past 5 months, and just when they seem to be getting better and I have a solid week, it all comes crashing down again.

At the beginning I was convinced that I was going to have a heart attack, then it was a pulmonary embolism, and now I think I have some kind of emphysema or lung cancer (I used to smoke and it haunts me). I can't make it stop, and it seems like once I handle one issue and a doctor clears me, my brain just latches onto another new thing and starts a new cycle of tracking symptoms, googling and doctors appointments. Like jesus fucking christ, enough already! It makes me feel so hopeless and sad, I don't want to go through this every day. It's like my own personal hell loop, because I feel like I can't trust my own brain to make rational decisions about anything.

"Dizziness, pressure in head, headaches, strange seizure-like episodes - brain tumor or sinus infection? Hey all. I'm making a doctor's appointment first thing in the moring but I'd like some advice on what I am experiencing in the meantime. 

For a couple months I have been getting these strange episodes that I can only describe as pseudo-seizures. One of the most notable symptoms is that I suddenly have this overwhelming sensation of physical buildup, like you get right before a good sneeze or before you start crying. However, that release doesn't come, so I get urges to make noise like moaning or screaming to force the feeling out. Another big symptom is a sudden inability or difficulty in swallowing. It's like I've forgotten how to move my tongue properly or like my mouth is too dry, and I can only partially swallow. I have to push food to the back of my throat so that it's already partially down and then struggle to get it the rest of the way. I stop eating when this happens because I don't want to risk choking. Other symptoms are a tightness in the back of my head, confusion, and sometimes waves of tingles or energy washing over my scalp. The waves are very brief, but will repeat over and over for up to 20 minutes. When they stop, the rest of the symptoms go away too. I havent gotten too many of these the past couple weeks but they were nearly constant a month ago.

For the past couple weeks I have been having sporadic dizzy spells that feel like my body is floating or like my brain is swimming around in my head. Sometimes I get queasy during these spells. I noticed that they seemed to come or be worsened when looking at screens like my phone or computer, so I eventually figured it must be cybersickness. I am using my devices less and more carefully, and the dizzy spells got better for a few days.

However, now I am having very uncomfortable pressure in my head that seems to move around. It is mainly in my temples and the back of my head, but sometimes I can feel it in my nose too. It ranges from being annoying to feeling like my head has been put in a gentle hydraulic press. I feel dizzy when the pressure worsens.

Every so often, my right hand will feel slightly numb, and it feels like I've lost some fine motor control in it. However it's hard to tell if that is real or is just anxiety. It could also be carpal tunnel because I am an artist and it's in the hand I use to do most everything. It usually goes away in a few minutes to an hour.

I have been dealing with issues with my eyeglass prescription for the past few months. My old prescription had run its course and had started giving me trouble so I went and got a new one a few weeks ago, but it's too strong so I'm getting them bumped down a bit now.

Here are my ""crazy"" concerns - brain tumor, adult-onset hydrocephalus, brain cancer (cancer is of least concern because I recently had bloodwork and it came back perfect, so I shouldn't have that)

My more realisic theories are - sinus issues like infection or irritation, anxiety, eye strain from not wearing my glasses and having an outdated/overpowered prescription.

I was getting my prescription rewritten today and my eye doctor looked at my eyes to see if he could find any sign of a tumor, and he said everything looked good to him but I'm still worried.

What are all your thoughts? Do you think those strange episodes are really seizures? Should I be worried I have a tumor?",Anxiety

"I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do it. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going. By tomorrow night, I (21 y/o UK university student) have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what I have written so far; the deadline is in May and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming Easter break. But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes, vague ideas and research over the last few months, but I don't have a clue what to do with it, or where to start.

I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life, and until a few weeks ago, I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago, my motivation, self-belief and general ability to work (which were all low to begin with anyway) just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other, and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education, I had not only failed with work, but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in, knowledge of or care for the subject, because I kept procrastinating, and because it's possible that I have ADHD (I don't want to know about this, but I think I have it). I missed the second one because of the same reasons, and because I failed the first one, so it didn’t make a difference if I missed the second one.

Since I got the email last week from my supervisor that I have to send him whatever I've been working on by tomorrow (Tuesday), I've not only not been working on the dissertation, but I've detached myself from it almost completely. I don’t like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it (literally and mentally) because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me (it was my choice after all) and i’ve done a lot of research (too much I think) and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this (which is every time i’ve ever done an assessment in my three years at university) it usually turns out alright, but I can't see how this one — of course, the most important one — will end in anything other than failure. So I’ve come all this way — from the start of uni three years ago, from the start of reception 17 years ago — and I've always, at the very least, managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.

I’m aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time, or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all, and will all, get through it, and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in, and all I see is people working; they’re focused, self-disciplined, and content to be here. But I’m not one of them. I know that I don’t belong here, and I don’t like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do, that I shouldn't be doing, but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that, especially me; I've always feared failure — the confirmation of it by my university and parents; the consequences of it practically and emotionally — and that's what’s driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to, never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.

So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college (which i didn't) then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to (not because I wanted to pursue a career — I have absolutely no ambition at all). And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible (I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life; the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me). But mostly, it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university, so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all, and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future — short, medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future, whether it’s “where do you see yourself in five years”, “what do you want to do with your life"" or even simply “do you have any plans for the weekend”, I’ve always given vague non-answers. I've been like this forever. Probably because I’ve been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. I think about the past (my childhood especially) every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. I’ve had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I don’t remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.

In case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting (let alone completing, or succeeding with) my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years (and it is years). I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but I do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone (including family) about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, because…well…where to start? Fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships; the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles I used to have (note: haven't had friends for five years). I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.

If anyone has read this far, you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far — and if you are a healthy, ‘normal’ person — you will have obviously thought to yourself, “Yeah, he needs therapy”. But I don't think I do, and I certainly don't want to. There’s a small part of me that desires to let it all out (I could write a book about all of my problems), but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking help…from anyone in fact. I think that’s the bottom-line: regardless of whether I need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, I don't think I want it. Not enough, anyway. I think I’d hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but I don’t think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious, personal stuff, but the little, trivial, specific things too. Is it because of a deep-rooted social anxiety, and my complete lack of social confidence, ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably ‘need’ help with — health anxiety, fear of the future, fear of the passage of time, the fear of failure, the fear of work, the fear of my dissertation — I don't care about help, or support, or self-improvement. I don’t want any of it because I think it won’t work for me, or that it doesn't apply to me. I don’t want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.",Anxiety
"Dry heaving I’ve been dealing with a really complex personal issue involving heartbreak/ loss of a person I deeply care about; certainly the worst pain I’ve experienced in my life thus far.

"Health Anxiety, what has worked for me - Hopefully it helps you I have health anxiety and it's taken me about 3 years to. It feels good to know that I am not crazy or feel like I am dying from cancer or having a stroke or whatever else it can be. The symptoms are all over the place one month it will be numb limbs, the next month my face feels tingly, the next month I have shortness of breath, then the next month is muscle cramps, the next is heart palpitations. Each time I   I've been to the doctor so many times its kind of silly. Here are some ways I cope with it. I have days where it's gone, mild days, and days where it's an episode. I am glad I found this group because it makes me feel like I am not alone. It's hard to talk with people about your health anxiety because most people don't understand. I think it's fine for people to not understand we all 

1. I see a CBT therapist 
2. I channel my thoughts into something creative (painting, woodworking, reading, writing, drawing etc.) 
3. I keep a journal about the symptoms/day to day occurrences 
4. I listen to classical/calming music before bed 
5. I allow myself to worry for an hour a day
6. In the morning for about 10 minutes, I tell myself I am healthy, people love me, and today will be great, you will be ok. 
7. I laugh/talk about it with my friends (not for everyone but it helps me to know that some people have health anxiety at a mild level)
8. I note all of the things that happened that have made me feel better and then I repeat them, in addition I also write down all of the things that made me feel bad and try to articulate why that make me feel bad.
9. Little to no Caffeine, I love coffee but limit myself to drinking coffee on good days. As coffee can sometimes really amplify my symptoms.  
10. Little to no alcohol, I limit my alcohol intake to social events and never drink on weekdays. I noticed that alcohol while it suppresses my symptoms it makes me into a monster emotionally, so I only drink when I am having a good day and not worried about anything. 
11. Find a hobby. I like to sail, a hobby that requires concentration around the boat and everyone on the boat it helps me be mindful of my surroundings. It's something that has me forget about the symptoms because there is no time. This one took me about a year but I am glad I invested my time into it. 

This list is a work in progress, my recovery has been slow and each month I set a small goal for myself. In the midst of the anxiety it's important to realize that recovery and healing take time it will never happen overnight and I think understanding this and setting very small goals has really helped me. My list above is months of testing out different methods to see what worked for me. Just remind yourself it takes time, you are not alone. ",Anxiety
"My health anxiety is spiralling I just got back from an eye check up for a new set of contact lenses and the optometrist told me my eyes are healthy and I just have a few eye freckles (they’re on the whites of my eyes and are light grey).

"Terrified of catching the flu after ENT visit. I've been a huge germaphobe for as long as I can remember. In the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress, but once cold and flu season pick up, it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. 

Earlier today, I had my bi-yearly appointment with my ENT to get my ears cleaned out (I produce a ton of wax). I was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now, and the flu is widespread. I took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. 

Thankfully, there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. I was called back quickly,  the nurse took some info, I sanitized my hands, and then my ENT entered the room. He shook my hand, and then sanitized his, and got to work cleaning me out. 

Once he finished I asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight, and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. He demonstrated it for me, and then asked me to try it. Ordinarily, I dont touch my face under any circumstances, but since I had just sanitized my hands and since I was just pinching the outside of my nose (I was careful not to get too close to my nostrils), I figured it would be okay. So I pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. 

On the drive home I started to think about it a bit more, and realized that after I sanitized my hands, I shook his hand, so my hands probably were not very clean when I pinched my nose shut. And I started to get really worried that in doing so, I probably exposed myself to tons of cold/flu germs that will infect me in the coming days. 

Now I'm anxious as can be, trying to find some rational reason why I shouldn't be worried here, so I can calm down a bit. I havent had any luck yet. Can anybody help me out here? 

Also, just for the record, I'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. We just started back in October, but unfortunately he's been out of town all of December for the holidays. I've backtracked a good bit in his absence. I'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because I have a vacation coming up next week and I really dont want to have a cold/flu while traveling.

"Can't think of a suitable name for this post  

I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$&amp; out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this:

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

"Rapid Heart Rate 24M, 6’ , 215 pounds 
I have what I believe to be anxiety disorder. I almost always have some sort of anxiety. Sometimes I feel a little cloudy and maybe even a bit u stable on my feet. The worst is when I’ll be working; doing something minimally exhausting but my heart rate will raise to over 120 and then the panic ensues. The rapid rate can last hours. Maybe I am a hypochondriac and the more I think and check my pulse the worse it gets. Does anyone else have this happen? I have asked my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist just to be sure. I’m currently on no medication.",Anxiety
"Lumps and bumps I just need somewhere to let this out. I have a skin disorder called hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). It’s pretty mild for HS, and the last few years it’s gotten much better. 

I have also noticed a couple of cysts. On the back of my head, my ankle, and on the batwing area of my arm. 

Doctors have looked at the cysts and told me they’re nothing to worry about, but I can’t stop worrying that it’s something else or that having these cysts means I’m developing others in dangerous spots- my brain or lungs. 

I stupidly looked up diseases that are cooccurring with hs- thinking it would make me feel better if I saw that people with HS are just more likely to develop some benign cysts- and it mentioned thyroid disorder (which I have) and lymphoma and heart disease (which I am constantly terrified about).

Talk me down. Anyone else have stuff like this?",Anxiety
"College Student w/ Anxiety: Dating Life I first developed severe anxiety and panic disorder in my senior year of high school. I can proudly say that with perseverance, proper medication, and the help of my lovely therapist, family, and friends, I was able to complete my senior year and begin college in the fall. I’ve taken a liking to this guy in my class, and we will hang out this weekend. I am very inexperienced in the dating world as I’ve only really gone out with three guys ever… none of which lasted more than a few months. Though I had not been diagnosed with anxiety in my sophomore year of high school, I began dating this guy whom I was pretty infatuated with. However, the first time he put his arm around me, I shook uncontrollably. I misread that as a sign that he wasn’t suitable for me when it was just anxiety. Fast forward to now, I am anxious about seeing this guy this weekend, and I am scared that these feelings of fear won’t go away even if we continue to see each other. Has anyone else been through this? What should I do? I don’t want to be limited from dating but l my body is giving me unclear signals of what to do.",Anxiety
"My Health Anxiety Symptoms Hi Everyone! 

As someone who has been struggling with health anxiety for the last 4 years, I have found the acknowledgment of potential anxiety symptoms to be the most reassuring form of support. This is not only reassuring to me as it reminds me of all of the different ways anxiety might affect your body, it also reminds me (and hopefully others) that many of these symptoms quickly pass, as they are only manifested *only* as a result of mental illness. 

Here's all of the symptoms that have come and gone as a result of my health anxiety. I hope that people may relate, and be reassured. I've bolded those symptoms which have remained more constant throughout the last 4 years. 

1. tingling extremities 

2. **cold hands and feet**

3. muscle spasms (mostly in leg, thought it was a blood clot, it was not) 

4. **tightness of muscles** particularly around neck and shoulders 

5. dry mouth

6. **bruxism**

7. chest pain, stabbing 

8. **chest pain, dull/achey** 

9. constipation/diarrhea (thought this was hypothyroidism, it wasn't) 

10. hair loss (thought this was PCOS, it wasn't) 

11. Paralysis like symptoms (this came in two ways. One: overthinking things that should be unconscious-- me, thinking about swallowing, resulted in my temporary inability to swallow liquid. Two: mid panic attack, thought I could not move legs. 

12. **pelvic, vaginal/vulva pain** (thought this was vulvar cancer, literally got a chunk cut out of my vulva to test. As soon as results came back negative, the pain stopped)

13. **headaches**

14. **HEADACHES**

15. **pressure in head, tightness** 

16. insomnia 

17. **lethargy**

18. difficulty concentrating 

19. hearing phantom ringing (always hearing my alarm clock, even when it's not going off) 

20. jitters

That is all! (I think). I hope this helped someone, please feel free to ask any questions. ",Anxiety

"Brain tumor anxiety Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit. I feel like recently I've been suffering from health anxiety. It suddenly came up out of nowhere. First I was convinced something was wrong with my heart, I started having lots of different symptoms and was truly convinced something was wrong. Got it all checked, and it turned out fine. Afterwards I still felt kinda sick, so I got a blood test done which came back clear. This was about 3 weeks ago. 

A bit later I started having these headaches, and my vision suddenly got worse (at least I got the impression). Now I don't know if this is purely because I started focusing on it, or that it actually is something bad. Anyway, I decided to go back to the doctor since I work in IT, and dealing with the vision thing and headaches was getting pretty hard.

&amp;#x200B;

He checked me, asked lots of different things but he didn't seem quite sure about what it was. He sent me to an eye doctor, got my eyes checked there, and it turned out I need resting glasses for screen work ETC. (My eyes have been bad my entire life, had glasses since I was 3). I've also been having this visual snow, again I think I've had this for a long time, but it's like my mind suddenly seems to notice and freak out about it, same with things like my tinnitus which I've also had for years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still just scared I may have a brain tumor, because of the bad vision and headaches. But, if I had a brain tumor, they would have seen it in the blood test from a few weeks back, right? Or no? The doctor or eye doctor would have rang the alarm bell if something was seriously wrong, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

"Ex-partier, now healthy but with major HA Wondering if anyone else has dealt with this!

I am now 27. When I was 18 I started a 6-year long party bender. Daily marijuana, pack of cigarettes a day, drinking 5-6 nights a week, MDMA every weekend. It was intense. I was on Zoloft at the time for my anxiety and depression due to a crappy upbringing and social anxiety.

Flash forward to now. Quit pills 4 years ago, quit weed 1.5 years ago, quit cigarettes a month ago and now only drink once or twice a week. HOWEVER. Since getting healthier and stopping substances, my body has freaked out and feels like complete garbage every day. I have constant heart palpitations, tingling and headaches. I've had ECGs, a brain CAT scan, MRI on my chest, lung x-ray, blood pressure monitor and numerous blood tests and literally they can't find anything wrong with me. I am sad because I feel worse now than I ever did during my party days, and according to doctors I am in great shape considering. Also go to the gym 3-4 days a week.

"Cross post with AskDocs -- random swelling?? Hello,

I'm a 23-year-old female, non-smoker, otherwise healthy despite an insane amount of anxiety. I've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while, but doctors I've seen haven't been concerned because I weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck -- an ENT basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. It's only one one side. During my appointment with the ENT though, I insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. She agreed, but said it could be caused by a ton of things. My cheek is a bit swollen on the inside, too. It's most notable right under my ear lobe, resting on my jaw. It feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face.

She referred me for an MRI with contrast, and suggested I cancel a sonogram I had scheduled because an MRI would be better, anyway (I did.) I haven't had that yet, but I'm really freaked out and wondering if there's anything else I should be concerned with or if I should take her advice to just chill. I've had ulcers on that side of the mouth before (12 at a time, two years ago, apparently caused by stress), I wore clear retainers for two years that could have caused swelling and I had impacted wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. They were more impacted on that side of my mouth. I'm not sure what to do, just wondering if I'm going crazy or if I'm right to be concerned. Also, I'm more short of breath lately (not like, short of breath in a way where I'm sweaty and my heart's beating fast. Short of breath like my throat feels tight.) But that could be caused by anxiety, too. Thanks for you help.",Anxiety

"Health issue or health anxiety So before i start, let me make clear that i do have some health issue Well had, i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery 2 years ago. Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months, its a few days after Christmas, im at granny inlaw having a good time, when My  girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon, we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in, he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then, but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.
Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home, i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor pain,and I get spells of dizziness.
At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound, ekg, bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine, except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue, though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling  of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER, they do the  usual checks plus a ct and guess what, im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion. 
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so, but extreme dissapointment, i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at, didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack, but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. 
Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong, ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist, and they havent found much that could explain the pain.
So im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven, but the moment i started trying it, i got issues with breathing Again. Its like something in me wants to keeper me in pain and afraid. I Hope some Will read this and give some input.",Anxiety

"Health Anxiety? Random abdominal pain, scared of going to the doctor and potentially hearing worst case scenario I’ve had a LOT going on since Christmas. I lost my grandmother to cancer, I’ve been sick, had a panic attack, felt grief out of nowhere for the first time which included pains, random anxiety, and somewhat a fear of my own health. 

I had diverticulitis at the end of October last year and it was the first time I realized “oh wow. I’m not invincible and there are more things than stomach aches”

With all of this going on, I’ve also now started to feel a small pain around my gallbladder. It mainly happens when I’m readjusting my position, sitting uncomfortably, etc. it feels almost swollen and like I’m squishing it (I’m a bigger guy). I’ve read things online for relief hoping it was just gas or it’d go away on its own. It’s definitely gotten better! When it’s not hurting I’d feel a pain in my lower right, or on my left side. All of these pains are a 0-3 max on the pain scale. 

I can’t decide if I’m just looking for something wrong, or if I’m having health anxiety. I’m just so scared to go to the doctor because I don’t think I’ve ever gone and heard good news. It feels like it’s getting better over time, but I wonder if I’m over analyzing every pain or feeling I feel now.

I know I should go to the doctor, but I’m scared of going and hearing I have to have surgery, or if I’d hear (hopefully) “it’s just irritated from a bad diet and lack of exercise. Lay off fatty foods and take 2 of these a day and you’ll be all good”",Anxiety

"Love Yourself Good morning Reddit users! I wanted to pass some words or love and support.

We are all here because of our health anxiety whether we have it now, or we had it in the past and we’re just trying to support others.

I wanted to tell everyone...

Breathe.

Why is that so important? Because when we are all trapped inside our own thoughts and obsessed with our problems we feed into our pain, our stress, and our anxiety. That’s what our anxiety wants! Take a moment to step back and relax, let your body unravel since it’s so tense you won’t even notice it! Close your eyes, take deep breaths just to let your mind go back to normal. Because if you continue to worry and stress, your symptoms of whatever you’re feeling get worse! Then you begin to analyze “new” symptoms and you’ll start to worry about those. So just breathe please.

We as human beings sometimes forget to love ourselves and appreciate the small steps we take against our anxiety! Please give yourself a pat on the back, congratulate yourself for taking this small step! Don’t ever feel like you’re alone, we’re all here to help each other because we want the best for each other, we might feel like we’re in a hole. But we can get out of here I promise you all, we just need the support and the love because with that we can counter attack the mind. It’s powerful, but we can’t let it take advantage of us! We gotta control it and use it to our advantage! 

I hope all you have a wonderful day, and week, and month, and year. Let this be our year! Let’s tackle this together!

First time poster, so be kind :)

"My story of HIV anxiety Hi there,

For the last month and a half I've been dealing with the worst health anxiety of my life. Prior to this my health anxiety has been me thinking i'm going to have a heart attack causing me to constantly check my pulse. Things along those lines. But my current situation is far more severe. Here it is, I've posted something on here before about it.

I met a girl and we talked for months. She is a sexual person and I am not, it took me months before I finally decided I could move past just talking. After sex with a condom the first few times, we had unprotected sex the next a few times. I know how stupid this is but its even more idiotic for someone with health anxiety as i've learned. We agreed it was okay to do because i had no sexual history and she had been tested negative for stds. After the last time, 2 weeks later i got very sick. My doctor called it the worst sore throat she had seen in a long time. Along with that came chills, body aches, fatigue. I had blood work done my doctor called to say I had mono. I had only kissed this one person, and I asked her she said she had mono 4 years before. 

However, I idiotically googled symptoms. As it turns out, HIV in its early stages has all the symptoms of mono. Combine that with having unprotected sex 2 weeks before feeling sick and immediately I become overwhelmed with fear. I began to notice other things wrong with my body that resembled acute HIV - my tongue has a coating on it that i think is oral thrush, a rush formed on my chest after i started to feel better. Other things started to appear like my stomach began to growl regularly and my legs turn red in the shower. This fear hasn't gone away for a month now to the point of it keeping me up at night and sporadic panic attacks when I think about it throughout the day.

I have to take a test to put this to rest and resolve it. I know how extremely unlikely it would be for me to have this. I asked if she had been tested for stds since and she said she had been very recently. On top of this, im not sure i can ever be intimate or sexual again if this is how im going to act. ",Anxiety

"Scared my doc won't take me seriously Hi all, I'm a new here, I've had health anxiety for about 6 years, it comes and goes a couple of times a year for me but when I have an episode it's BAD, I'm talking like exacerbating my own physical symptoms by worrying, googling for hours until I'm convinced I'm going to die, hell even obsessing over my pets health and running them to the vets for every tiny thing, although that mostly started after my old kitty died of lymphoma.

Anyway so I'm really worried about going to the doctor next week that she's not going to take me seriously if I tell her I have health anxiety.  I think that I have PGAD, although granted my anxiety does seem to be making it way worse, I do have actual symptoms and reason to believe it.  I'm actually just kind of hoping it's all in my head but at the same time I'm worried that if I don't get tested and assessed for it it will turn out to be real and not just my anxiety 😭 I hate that feeling of uncertainty 😭",Anxiety

"Distrust of doctors and diagnoses - how to overcome? I've had quite severe health anxiety for a few years. It's hopped from one malady to another, and medical counsel/tests do not assuage it as I'm always convinced they've missed something.

Most recently it's cancer - at first lymphoma, now cancer in general. I've visited specialists, GPs, had chest xrays and bloodwork, and finally a full CT scan with contrast. Despite the all clear in each instance, I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.

I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD -- but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue, after numerous misdiagnoses etc. That GERD must be stomach cancer, the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma, the doctors are brushing me off, the medical system in Korea is inadequate, the medical system in Australia is inadequate (I've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!)

I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases I'm operating on here, but I don't know how to change them. For those who have endured something similar - how do you learn to trust the doctors' ""all clear""? How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness, and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?

Sleep tips for Anxiety and Stress Recently I’ve been going through a really stressful period of my life and it has also greatly increased my anxiety. This makes it especially difficult to sleep. I often take 2 hours laying in bed to fall asleep and then wake up about 3-4 times a night and I can’t even tell you the last time I got a full 7-8 hours. I often wake up due to vivid dreams or maybe just due to all the things on my mind which I think may be contributing to poor sleep I often have to take a melatonin in the middle of the night to fall back asleep. I also take magnesium supplements sometimes but I’ve had my ups and downs with them as they tend to increase the vivid dreams (I also quit weed sorta recently which may factor into why I’ve been having so many vivid dreams and having sleep troubles) I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on how I could get better sleep and any other supplements that may help with it if needed.

I get occasional sinus infections and every time I google them it says “chance of sinus infection turning into deadly meningitis”.

"Self-diagnoses, panic attacks, and hope Here's my story. Last summer I convinced myself that I had intestinal parasites and kind of lost it. I finally went to the doctor and it turned out to just be a yeast infection (health anxiety, right?). Well it was a really intense yeast infection. Got it under control after finishing medicine from doctor and then purchasing OTC medicine. 

Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack, and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning, I felt like I got a ""hot flash"", and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. 

So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer (thanks, WebMD). I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point, I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. (Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV, which had recently been clearing up. That's another story). So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal x-ray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the x-ray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. 

Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then, my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream, and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed, which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. 

I started a gluten-free diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a follow-up blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot, though still nothing like it used to be.  

So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While gluten-free has definitely helped, and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety, in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress, and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before. ",Anxiety

"actual problems mixed with anxiety I have one legitimate issue that i will get an appointment for on monday (sadly, the weekend is inbetween).  
My BPM, which usually is around 55-65, got higher and flip flops around a lot (it is between 80 and 100 now when i am sitting or lying down) and my bloodpressure similarly got a tad higher (not to worrying heights, it is below 140) and, what is worrying me, flip flops around a lot when i take several measurements (like going from 100 to 130 and back several times when i do not move and measure 10 times over the course of some minutes, even when i am sitting still and relaxed).

This is an issue i legitimately think might have to do with my thyroids (no cancer fears about the thyroids, i think it might just be hyperactive and that makes sense because i am celiac and celiacs often have other autoimmune diseases, most commonly thyroid stuff).

Now to what actually makes me scared and is probably nothing:

Today, after a long time of it not happening (happened a lot before my celiac diagnosis), my whole body vibrated with my pulse (i could feel it everywhere, most importantly neck), my pulse was actually off (too high, above 100 even when sitting, sometimes going as far as near 120) and i felt pressure in my gutts and chest. The pressure was so bad that, depending on how i moved, it felt like organs press on organs and i felt sick.

My neck was not only vibrating with my pulse, it also got very tensed (not some kind of stiffness that made it unable to move, but i felt like someone grabbed me just at the start of the back of my head and pressed his finger into it, shutting down the blood flow except for the very strong pulsations).

I had these symptoms before (more or less) as i said, and I assume that it is Roemheld syndrome (a benign, but very scary kind of thing) because i know that my heart is fine. It got very thoroughly checked back then and it was fine in the months before, i could do sports, i am not feeling weak, i am not having syncopes).

Roemheld syndrome means that you got so much pressure in your gutts due to air and food that it presses against your heart, chest and lungs so you experience very scary sensations, similar to angina pectoris, but it is not actually dangerous. Your heart rate is increased, your chest feels tight, you might have shortness of breath, but you are going to be fine once the pressure is gone. But that can take a long time and in that time you think you will die and you need to go to the ER.

I had that today, the first time in almost a year and i was kinda broken that it came back. I thought i beat it, and then suddenly here i am, thinking i got a lung emboli, or my veins are shut down, or there is a tumor pressing on my heart or veins. Or i got a brain aneurysm because i also felt pulsations in my head and heard noises in my air (i dont think these are noises it usually makes when you got very high bp, since my bp is not actually that high and it was only one air AND i got a head MRT the year before and it was fine).  


Now, i am very sure that roemheld is what caused this, because yesterday i drank a lot of booze and cola while eating and i had a bit of pressure before that to begin with, but the reason that i am still like 'ya, gonna die' is that i lost so much weight compared to last time.  
I lost more than 10 kilo so there should be far more space for my innards. I am not overweight anymore.

So, what my anxiety brain thinks is this: Back then, a tumor right behind my sternum, pressing on my heart. Ofc the pressure got better when i lost weight and stuff, but now it grew enough to make up for it and it presses again against my heart and no doctor will check for that (obviously the tumor is not visible via sono but NEEDS MRT or CT) and at some point it will just destroy my heart and I will die. Or my neck or bones presses on important veins and i will also die because the vein will burst (even tho i had an mrt of the neck (for legit reasons) just 2 months ago and while my neck had issues, noone said anything about veins).

&amp;#x200B;

I am fine now because i drank a lot of herbal tea that helps with roemheld, but i am still here thinking about tumors and also thyroid cancer.

As a bonus point, i think about it even being my own fault because i might have ingested gluten accidently (i probably didnt, but i live, for some time, with a non celiac so there is some chance there was contamination of my food, but he is careful and i am too, so it aint probable) and the gluten made the belly angry.

I really hope this was a one time thing and i am not falling back into anxiety due to roemheld, i will be extra careful about food in the next days.  


I will not eat today until the belly died down (and sadly my eating choice are limited due to celiac in any case, not a lot of good 'get healthy' food, at least not in my flat) and drink very much of the herbal tea.

&amp;#x200B;

When i feel better, i will do some sit ups and push ops to try to straighten out my belly and i will massage my neck as much as i can.

So far i am at least not predialing the medics anymore.

"Can a lot of strenuous intense exercise after each other in a day cause heart damage? It was more than a week ago where my heartrate was high all day. For some reason I  believe I damaged my heart without feeling any significant pain. This kind of thinking is fucking scary. It sends you right down the rabbit hole of anxiety. My heart was tested extensively almost a complete year ago and it turned out well.

But then I rationalize that something bad happened and my perception of my beating heart becomes clearer and clearer and I feel it more and more.

I don't know what to fucking do now. I am too lazy to go to a doctor again, to test myself for the so manyth (&lt;-- not a word) time. But I have to.. Or not? Or do I.. I might die if I won't..

"It finally got the best of me I have suffered with health anxiety over the past year but it’s been increasingly worse the past few months. This along with the stress I have been under lately has been a disastrous combination. My heart rate has been higher than usual lately along with this weird pain in chest and shoulder,obviously leading me to constantly believe I’m having a heart attack. Also I’ve been somewhat struggling with more intense allergy symptoms. 
I don’t have health insurance so I’ve been trying to just ignore it and chalk it up to stress but of course my mind wonders and then I go to google. The past month alone I’ve convinced myself that I have various heart issues, brain tumors, ALS and so many more. 
So, long story short, yesterday it got the best of me and I had a panic attack and went to urgent care. The nurse practitioner has pretty much decided it’s all stress related but decided to do an EKG and a few blood tests anyway. The EKG came back fine and he says by the look of things I seem pretty healthy. Unfortunately the blood test result won’t be in until Saturday so that’s weighing on me because I’m obviously thinking the worst but he prescribed me some anxiety meds and they have helped slightly. 
But it still sucks to be such a prisoner in my own mind. ",Anxiety
"Rewilding Helped Me Beat Health Anxiety Hey guys, my personal experience with health anxiety came from seemingly nowhere. One day I had chest pain, and then every day for months after that I dug myself deep into this dark chasm that is health anxiety. At my lowest, I was up till 4 am on WedMD every night, almost got fired from my job, and most importantly - living in chronic PHYSICAL pain.   


The TLDR of my story is that rather than seeking ""comfort"" (hot baths, heating pads, painkillers), I began to seek ""discomfort"" and that led me to what I now understand as ""rewilding"".   


Basically, you are reaffirming your body how strong and capable you really are, by exposing yourself to elements that we humans previously had to deal with constantly....long before the days of anxiety lol.   


Take some cold showers. Go out into the elements for at least 20 minutes a day. Develop a deeper relationship with your breath.   


If anyone is interested in more information on this, I'll happily write an article, but I'm not an expert, just a practitioner. The man responsible for the term is [Daniel Vitalis](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-podcast/).   


But there are others doing similar stuff, such as Wim Hof.   


Reaffirming to myself that I am strong was the only thing that pulled me out, and it started with seeking discomfort, learning some stoicism, and severing the emotional attachment I had to my physical symptoms. You can do it too.   


Love

"Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long, but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. 

I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now, and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control, I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.

It all started just over a year ago, when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why, as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.

Since then, I've been fine. I have ibs, which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things, asthma, skin problems, but nothing unmanageable.

I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind, then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food, had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.

Ibs is more under control now, but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general, have quite a foggy head alot of the time, don't really feel like myself, don't want to do much, getting tired out easy, feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.

The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.

Any time I find the tiniest little lump (found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach) I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't, any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.

It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding, being hyper aware of every tiny sensation, looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.

It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day, I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.

Anyone got any advice, or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about, but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something. ",Anxiety

"Anxiety over tests Hi there, aside from therapy, wondering if any of you could share advice about how to get over anxiety when doing medical tests. 

I recently had an ultrasound and was in tears during it bc I had convinced myself that something scary would be found. It was to the point that the radiologist came to talk to me and gave me the results on the spot. I greatly appreciated this but I understand is not possible every time. 

I have a follow up MRI scheduled for next week (likely to confirm an incidentaloma) and I’m having a VERY hard time. I’ve rescheduled it twice and I dread the two days I will have to wait for the results. The anxiety is crippling.

"Heart anxiety for no reason Hello all,

First post on here, there's some really good advice from people in here so hopefully someone will have been through something similar to me. 

I just wondered if anyone else has the same thing as me. I am anxious about having a heart issue, every day, and this doesn't seem to be based on anything at all. There's no family history, I'm relatively young (32), have had all the heart checks available with nothing being found, my cholesterol is fine, and I can do mild exercise with no pain (I'm pretty unfit and just started doing exercise so I'm at a mild level). I threw away my blood pressure monitor because I think it was feeding my anxiety but when I used to take it, it was always in the normal range. 

But every day, I'll feel my heart beating in my chest at random times. Sometimes when I'm lying on my side, and in certain positions on the sofa. Sometimes I'll feel a strange vibration feeling in my chest. Or I'll feel my heart beat normally, then seem to stop, then thump back into rhythm. My partner will put her ear to my chest and tells me it's beating normally but to me, it feels like it's thumping and missing beats.

When I get any of those sensations, I'll worry about what it means and I'll feel panicky, especially if I'm on my own, or in a situation that I can't escape from, such as a plane or recently, on the London Eye ferris wheel. Maybe it's the thought of help not being easily available to get to me. The current snow in England is making me a little panicky that help won't get to me.

Along with those weird heart sensations, I'll get chest discomfort, like a heavy indigestion feeling, sometimes odd feelings in my arm, sometimes light headed feelings. None of it is painful, it's just like weird sensations. 

I've attempted to put my chest sensations down to digestive issues such as acid reflux and I've tried eating better and exercising to improve my health but so far, it hasn't made much difference.

I don't know if there is something going on that no one can find or whether I'm literally doing it all to myself.

I'm not an anxious person normally. I can talk in public, I'm not socially anxious at all, it seems to be this one and only issue and I've no idea where it came from. 

Does anyone else get these feelings, and if so, how do you ignore them and how have you managed to reduce them? ",Anxiety

Of course I immediately thought of the c word. Since then I have noticed the pain move around and change slightly. Now it is like an ache in my thoracic spine. I also get painful tight neck pain. And I still have ongoing low back pain with sciatica since about 18 months.
My physiotherapist says he doesn't think it is anything serious and to just train harder in the gym.

"Health Anxiety / Phobias I had posted this in the general anxiety sub, someone pointed me to this sub in the comments so I'm cross-posting here: 

I'm new here.  I've suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember, but it took an existential crisis for me to seek treatment about 10 years ago.  I've been medicated ever since.  The meds definitely help me feel more ""normal"", but I'm never 100% without anxiety.  It's still always there.  

I have some chronic health problems, and after suffering for years (see a pattern here?) I have finally gotten up the nerve to try to figure out what is wrong.  For years I've told myself my symptoms are just anxiety related (IBS, body pain, fatigue, extreme migraines, etc.)  It has now gotten to the point where I'm sick more often than not, I'm missing a lot of work and I'm not able to be a good mother or wife.  I'm spending most of my time in the fetal position in bed.  I'm in pain all of the time, sometimes so severe I can barely move.  I'm losing weight without trying.  I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. 

The problem is, I am really freaked out by doctors and all the associated medical tests/procedures.   I have a GP who handles my anxiety meds, and I see her regularly, but I am awful at getting tests done and awful at seeing specialists .... even though I know logically that I need to go do these things to find out what is wrong with me so I can get better.  

In a moment of bravery, I made myself appointments with all of the specialists I've been told to see over the years... gastroenterologist, neurologist, rheumatologist, dentist and oral surgeon.   I've gone to a couple of the appts and of course all of them want me to get tests done or bloodwork done.  I feel paralyzed when I think about getting those things done.  For example, I have orders for bloodwork.  I just have to walk into the lab and let them draw blood.... super easy and no big deal.  I have driven myself there 5 times in the last week and been unable to force myself to walk through the door to get it done.  I break out in a sweat, panic, and get back in the car and leave.  Then I spend the rest of the day hating myself for it.   Feeling like an idiot because I didn't get it done.  

My GI doctor also ordered an ultrasound, which I forced myself to do (I've had two kids and knew US were easy, so this didn't freak me out as much).  However, she called me back to tell me that my US results are abnormal and that they might need to do a biopsy... so of course now I am absolutely freaking out.  

Does anyone else have this problem?  I feel paralyzed and terrified over the simplest things and hate myself for it.  I need to stop being such a coward and get this stuff done so I can figure out why I am so sick and try to fix it. ",Anxiety

"I'm Going Crazy (Brain Tumor fear) Hey guys.
(Sorry if my grammar may seem a bit choppy. English is not my first language). 
I'm running into alot of anxiety. I feel like I'm losing my mind at this point. 

I have been experiencing neurological symptoms that seem to come and go by months. It all started on Thanksgiving. The very first symptom was a strange headach. It was dull yet slightly painfull. What followed afterward was strange weakness feeling in my sholdure and jaw. These symptoms suddenly went away the after. A week I had expreinces no symptoms. In the beginning of December, I began to experience these same symptoms again. 

All day I could not keep my mind off of these symptoms. I eventually succumbed into a full blown panic attack. Those specific moment felt like I was about to die. 
The symptoms continued throughout the month of December. During this time I was able to go to my family doctor. He seemed to shrug it off.
They took my blood, which turned out to be normal. 
My anxiety not stopping either. These symptoms would occasionally relive than come back. There are period where these symptoms would become stronger and new ones will form. I began to expreince strange dizziness. My balance also felt slightly off. I could not keep my mind off of it. 

After Christmas, my symptoms seemed to have completely vanished. The symptoms seem to have been gone for a good month or so.  Somehow everything felt better and I thought that was the end of that.  

Boy was I wrong. 

The symptoms all returned. And back came my anxieties of impending doom. 
I did notice that these symptoms returned when my period was beginning to start. It did get worse when I was on my period.... I don't know if that matters. 

I'm still very worried that I have a brain tumor. I feel like that my family and friends think im going crazy, but they just dont understand. I'm scared and have no where to go... ",Anxiety

"Anxiety Symptoms I'm new to this Reddit thing but I have been reading posts in this subreddit for a couple of weeks now and I thought I would post about my anxiety symptoms. I am recently struggling with the thought that this really is anxiety, my biggest fear is of course the big C-word, lymphoma for example. Everything started in November about 4 months ago, on vacation in Vietnam. I experienced what I think was my first panic attack with heart palpitations, pressure on chest, difficulty to breath etc. Since then, I have experienced so many different symptoms and sensations such as lump in throat, feeling of not getting enough air, difficulty to breath, waking up several times every night (sometimes with a strange feeling of fear), lately my skin feels like its burning or is sensitive, it also sometimes feels like my heart flutters, skips a beat or is just pounding out of my chest but not a fast heartbeat just very hard and powerful. I also experience headaches like never before, extremely cold feet pretty much all the time. Man, I've probably missed a few sensations too but this is really getting to me. I've had EKG, echo, blood work done to test my thyroid etc and all came back clear. I'm thinking about how I feel all the time and I am noticing every little sensation in my body and the smallest thing can set me off into almost panic for a few seconds. Lately its been more of pressure on my chest and difficult to breath thats been the worst symptom. On top of this, I had a cold for about three weeks ago and I felt a lymph node that was swollen, this set my health anxiety off into a frenzy and I can't stop thinking about it ever since. I can still feel the lymph node ( I'm touching it all the freaking time hoping its gone, knowing that I shouldn't) and my doctor said it was nothing to worry about, but as you know, health anxiety finds its way back no matter what.

I’m pissed and I’m scared and I hate myself and I hate people around me and I wish I could just end it all right here and right now but I can’t because IM TOO MUCH OF A PUSSY. The closest thing I can do is starve myself and throw my guts up, which is a fun little tradition that I’ve had for over a year. Thankfully, my mother, being the kind soul she is, tells me that is bad and will make me fat. Thanks mom! I’m just so sick of this. I’m powerless and weak and I know I am and I wish I had access to a rope right now. I’ll probably forget all about this in the morning too, it’s just that today was a fucking hell day.

"Yea so I am in my mid-30s, got a great wife and son, that part of my life is wonderful. My job is high paying and I absolutely hate it. Feel like I am failing most of the time. Had depression since my teens but somehow I have been able to navigate life and been somewhat successful financially. No matter these successes, I just feel f-ing worthless most of the time. I feel like the work I produce is not any good, though I do not get told that. I have almost 0 confidence. I was on the SSRI train for a while, but been off for 3 years. I am eaten up with worry most of the time, about stuff that is not even real. I do not have any friends beyond my wife, who is amazing and struggles with her own anxiety and family issues. I am really looking for a strategy to stop feeling so worthless. As a man, it is really difficult to find other people who understand. I need to be present for my family and provide, it just always feels like I am minutes from failure. And the worst part is that I know deep down inside I just want to give up sometimes.

"Hope this is allowed if not get rid of it . Just wanted to get something off my chestIm 22 recently graduated from college I found out at half one this morning thst i was rejected for my dream job (througha friend thst got onto the next stsge) . Another rejection to add to the list. I have already been rejected by all the other msjor companies in the field I am graduating into in this country. I am a laughing stock and a waste of space. A let down to my fsmily and all my dead relatives whom I promised that i would make proud. I have not. I cannot put myself through another interview process. How could I? I will be turned down . I know I am good at what I do but nobody can see that. The people who matter do not have faith in me. what is wrong with me? Why am i so useless as a person? As for my personal life? Another stream of rejections. Any time I get close to somebody romantically it takes them about 3 dates for her to realise I am a waste of their time. I am not a horrible person either. Quite the opposite I have been told that too often I am too nice to people. Maybe that is my lack of worth as a person manifesting itself through helping somebody else. I do not hate my life i just hate that I am who I am . I wish I could be anybody else. Somebody of worth. Somebody that is not humiliated every time they do an interview, every time they ask a girl out, everytime they think they are getting somewhere. Why bother? I am a waste of breath and I wish i could change thst but I am too far gone. Before you think my ill feeling towards myself manifests itself in interviews etc it does not i cover it up. And the last time i was told i was not good enough for a job ie todsu it was not even an interview as such but a task. I do not even know why I am posting this. It is not a cry for help, it is not a pity me fest. it is more so a case of needing to get it off my chest. Sorry for being a burden not only to you but onto my fsmily and my wider social circle. I had not seen a man more useless until i looked in the mirror. Have a nice day, i can assure you it will be better than mine I feel completely useless and hopeless. I am a joke of a person .

"Wasting away First time Poster so I apologize in advance for any formating issues. 
I just came to realize how numb I feel today. For some contest I (24F) have been struggling  mentally pretty much since childhood.I've had low self-confidence,anxiety and have been pretty depressed for as long as I can remember. Life has always kinda sucked and any good times usually don't last more than a couple of days so I guess all the hurt and disappointment has been building up and now I'm almost completely numb aside from the random anxiety attacks at 3am.
I've been aware of this for a while, but the sheer extent of how tired I am and how I don't care about anything anymore hit me today when I found out that all the neglect towards my studies has caught up to me and will most likely result in me either barely passing uni or not even being able to graduate meaning I will have no degree and just wasted a bunch of time for nothing. The tought of that used to scare me, but now I just don't care that much . I am so lost on how to improve but at the same time I don't have the desire to do anything about it. All I wanna do is sleep and not wake up I wish time would just stop. I don't know why I'm writing this for some advice maybe ?or just venting to strangers online is alot easier and cheaper than therapy.",Depression

its sad. the thing i miss most about him. is the way he tasted. what kind of human answer is that. im a monster. a devil. i would kiss him for hours. until his lips were bruised. i would take the anger i have for this life out on him. i could still hear him gasping for air. i look at my hands and wonder why. 

i've been depressed my entire life. it was cruel of me to spread it to him. he was an angel. and i set him on fire to keep me warm. im a walking black hole who tried to destroy him. but he survived. he has a pretty good life now it looks like, well, from the outside anyway. but my soul won't heal. and i can't forgive myself. and he never will. he never should. 

i can't care about anything anymore. my parents loved me so much. my friends and family too. but i can't feel it. i don't deserve it anyways. there's no reason why or how someone like me could be so evil. i feel like a murderer. this isn't depression. these are just consequences. you wouldn't say a murderer serving his sentence in prison, in solitary confinement, has depression. he's inhuman. he can't feel a thing.",Depression
Stuck in a loop TW ED MENTION I feel trapped and stuck. Whenever I get super depressed I tend to eat a lot and because of my eating disorder it just ends up making me feel like more shit which causes me to binge and ect ect. I don't know how to stop,Depression
"third wave covid's hitting my country , which is under coup(no freedom, civilians murdered,all sorts of violence) and on the brink of economic collapse. On top of that I am naturally depressed, and these circumstances just remind me of how right i am that life is pointless, nth makes sense and everyday is suffering.

"So, some back story. I am 27 (F) and this person 23 (M), my younger brother I believe has threatened me during a very heated verbal fight. For our entire lives, he has smashed walls, kicked walls, punched walls, broken things, all the time. He stomps the floor when he hears people walking past his room because it pisses him off and smashes the ceiling above him when he hears his family, including me walking around upstairs as he works out downstairs. He constantly always has had rude responses and is always extremely disrespectful and demeaning when someone is trying to just be civil with him. I have ruled it out over the years and he has abusive actions. He shows silent treatments, holds you accountable for your weaknesses. There is NEVER any wining against him. He has destroyed most of the house. We get in heated fights often. Today, I left my room as he was getting ready for work to see what he was up to and I proceeded to tell him to cleanup his dishes in the kitchen and to clean them because I was sick of cleaning up after him all weekend and this is where it began, he freaked out and told me I do not do anything, meanwhile I cleaned the house all weekend, cleaned after his mess he leaves on the counters. I proceeded to tell him to be respectful towards me. he proceeded to tell me I am a waste of space I do not deserve to live home and I do not deserve anything and that whenever someone asks him how I am doing, he tells them I am a bitch and a piece of shit. he then told me, ""I deserve what is coming"". I am not sure what this means but it is scary. He does own a shotgon he keeps laying on his bed with rounds and he said he is soon buying another rifle. I genuinly did feel threatened and scared, I often do around him, I often get thoughts he is going to swing open my door and shoot me in the back of the head. he has no sense of remorse or sympathy whatsoever. Never answers my phone calls or texts. Someone please give me your insight on this. Do you think I was threatened? Also, yes I am very much old enough to move out. I have struggled with PTSD my entire life and have recently been struggling with extreme anxiety and depression. and I am slowely trying to get out of an extremely hard and dangerous time in my life of self harm. This situation makes it extremely difficult to better my life and be happy, I cannot be myself here. he has ALWAYS put me down for my insecurities and my past of not eating and being scared of life. He tells people I am a horrible person because of my PTSD and my weaknesses and calls me a loser. it is extremely hurtful. I have been sitting here texting a friend just trying to relax and be okay. I just do not know what to do anymore, whenever I do move out, I want to get a restraining order against him because I do not want him apart of my life anymore. I think I have been threatened by a family member I live with",Depression
"I apologize its kind of a long post and kind of a rant to get it off my chest.I am 25(m) and have no idea what to do. I feel like I am in a stalemate with life. I am married to an amazing woman who I cannot make happy anymore. And it may be due to her post-partum depression. But like I have lost all motivation to try and fix things because I feel like they cannot be fixed. All we do is fight and argue and it feels like were both walking on eggshells 24/7. I have recently gotten help and gotten on medication to help me but all it does it help me hold in my emotions more instead of express them which ends with me blowing up every couple of weeks. I have lost the motivation to take care of myself. I have put on weight. Started smoking cigarettes even more and struggle to do normal things like dishes and clean the house.Also I am working myself to death it feels like. My body is destroyed from my younger years and I have a very physical labor job but I cannot leave it because it pays to well.It feels like the only things that make me happy right now are my 8 month old son who I love so much, and my little alone time I get to myself to play video games.I just feel like I am under a ridiculous amount of stress and I am depressed af and just do not know what to do. I have lost all motivation",Depression

"I am writing this not knowing if I will ever actually send it; I do not know why I get so anxious when I think of you or make an attempt to reach out. All my thoughts disappear and the only thing I experience is this weird, warm sensation in my chest: there is nothing but a feeling of faintness, like my insides are slowly evaporating. Images flash of what I think your life is like today and I also see memories of other times we have been together. These latter are mostly from moments all our families have been together, I mean the families you have joined with in marriage and our own blood relations. My reflections of the weddings (that I know I was at in the flesh) I experience in the same manner as I envision how your current life is like, as if I am a passive observer, as if I am dead or a ghost. I saw a picture of me at your wedding and I remember feeling so out of place in that world, I recall it now as if I were never there, disconnected and a complete stranger. Sometimes I ask myself if I will ever see you again, I imagine our lives forever separated as if that were the answer but it does not really seem any different than its ever been even when I did appear at various holidays and family gatherings.My life today is just a meager attempt to scrape buy, do the bare minimum just to keep living for what? I do not know. I work by myself and mostly just sit in my truck and read when I should be working. I do not really care. I can get away with it so I do it. I would not say I am depressed, I can get by most of the time without ever having a sad thought: most of my life these days is characterized by indifference. I think about trying to change my life in some way but mostly nothing comes of it, I do not really care. I am just another life amoung millions of others doomed to die in obscurity. Sometimes I see myself as having potential to do great things but then I take revenge on this cruel world by becoming a martyr who will die with this potentiality in my grave. At times I wish I had been born thousands of years ago instead of today. This modern world is grotesque and foreign to me, the paths in life we are limited to tread are dehumanizing. Sure, many people make their own path but I lack the strength and imagination. I do still dream of the perfect life. For me it would be a life of endless travel. There are so many places in the world I would love to visit. But then again I know I am doomed to live my days out in this miserable country, in this pathetic world of an era that cannot even give us the satisfaction of failing so we can create something better. No. I am afraid man is doomed to stagnate forever in the filth of democracy and freedom, mere titles and images while the few toxic hands of corruption really &lt;i&gt;live&lt;i&gt; on the backs of the bodies that suffer in the transcendence of eternal hope.I am rambling but my point is this world is lost to me. I do not have any hope, and without anything to believe in a man cannot be said to exist. I suppose this is why I experience your presence, current and past, as a ghost or as if I have never existed all along and this life is only a dream with my body a mere paroxysm of nerves whose only force is born in the desire to exist.Looking at these words I probably will not send this message. But this is the gulf I so desperately want to bridge but I know my breath is lost in that void so sending it is still the same as not. If I am practically dead already why not make it official? I can never send you these words; how could I? My life is so diametrically opposed to yours. I am afraid I am doomed to live like this. I am deathly afraid. I have no place here. A message to the void",Depression
"Sometimes it feels like everything is not real. Nothing I do matters and it seems like the world will never stop. I look around and everything I see is awful.

And the world is dying! But no body cares at least not enough people do in order to do anything about it. Everything just sucks and trying to simply exist is too difficult.

"I have felt this way for 6 years now. I feel so permanently stuck in this depressive, hollow, empty life. I have become so numb to everything that it hurts to think about how much I have changed..I tend to keep myself from relationships due to my emotional unavailability from depression because I will know that anyone I date will just feel ignored. I do not want to hurt anyone and do genuinely care about people, even if they do not care about me.I am terrible at explaining my emotions and I apologize ahead of time if this sounds jumbled and repetitive. When I was 10 I was raped. As a male I was pretty much ignored because my attacker was female and it sucked. Losing 2 loved ones to cancer, my dad had a stroke, and my mom was unavailable because she had to take care of my father. When I finally told my parents they supported me fully and took very good care of me to get mental health support. My life has been pretty much existing day to day. Not living, just existing. I feel completely numb and have spent most of my days begging to God for something to change, pleading that my life will be better but it has not. I have tried several coping skills for depression but they always seem to be temporary and never last no matter how long I use them.Over the years I have been officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, PTSD and ADHD. All of which culminate into a bundle of nerves and depression that desperately wishes for the touch of others yet is too scared to let anyone near him or get to know him. My friends that do genuinely know me and care for me have stuck with me for years and I have never been more grateful for anything in my life.My sister is my best friend and she has helped me through so many issues that I could never repay her for. I feel guilty for venting to her sometimes though because she has her own issues and she does not need more to add to her pile.Most of my day is spent sleeping, eating, and reading or playing video games on the occasion where I feel even remotely alive enough to do so.I have never self harmed or attempted suicide and never plan on it for the sake of my family and friends but that does not mean I do not wish I did not exist sometimes. I hate myself for what I have become and worry every single day that I will become nothing and end up somehow more worthless than I already am. I know I am intelligent (please do not think I am bragging I promise you I am not), and that is the worst part. I know I have potential, but I am so downtrodden and depressed that I have no motivation or drive to accomplish anything. My love for history and geography is something that I cling to, because I do not have much left.So here I am, here is all that I am, and I do not know what I am doing anymore. I mind feels so permanently foggy and confused that I cannot even think straight anymore. I am in this constant daze and I just want to think right for once. Numb",Depression
"I have recently come to terms with the fact that I have mental health issues stemming from a lot of childhood trauma and started to seek help. I have been more open about talking to peers, I have been seeing a therapist, etc. these all seem and sound like good things but it honestly feels like its worse than its ever been. My mind is constantly racing with all these negative thoughts and I try to deal with them with positive self-talk but it just feels so pointless and stupid to me. Its hard to get out of bed everyday and all I want to do is go home and be alone in the silence. The thing is, I am not even happy when I am there. I just feel so alone all the time. I had a buddy call me this morning and tell me he appreciated me and all sorts of positive things but I cannot even find the energy to care.

On my 16 and 17 I practically did nothing, however on my 17 I woke up in the middle of the day to just go down stairs pretend to look happy to then walk back up to then start crying because of how fucked and lonely I was, I have had a year of isolation because of covid but honestly life has been shit.i was already down mentally but i first got depressed after I went to college sixth form for something I was not even interested in, I could get into detail on how everything messed up but I want to focus on the impact of this. I would stay up all night and go in the morning to comeback home tired and to hope I would survive the next day, aslo I would get work done at 4am in the morning to just to prove I did something. Everyday I would go to bed at 5am or did not at all to then just sit on the computer. I was already careless of myself because I would not shower for up to 3 months and listened to music to then cry because I was trapped and always reflected on life. I had no energy to do anything, like I said it was a struggle to even bother washing. Overall I was dreading life and I was scared for my future including suicide, while this was happening my mum was too worried about me getting kicked out of the college and not about my health which just made me feel like a failure which I know I was. I finally just left the college to hopefully do something new and get my head sorted, but I am still lonely and wake up at midday with little energy. I am writing this at 5 am while everyone is gone including my half brother who is with his dad and my mum who is fucked off with a man, so I am left alone with just my thoughts like every weekend. Right now I get depression because I have lost interest in the things i loved and no energy to do anything, also anxiety because I am scared of what I will end up as. I have never thought about killing myself because Ik it will be selfish for my family but at the moment life is not looking promising. it is weird because you never think you would feel like this as a kid.

"What is this, what is it You can’t help me. You can, but you can’t. You could care, so you can help me. But you won’t, so you can’t. 

I see that now. I was hoping someone would not come and fix everything for me but that they would care. I tried it all, I tried caring so that maybe someone would too. I tried not to expect anything back and I did that but when things got rough and I cried for help, no one was there. People would only take from me, and now that I’m kind of empty, with nothing left to give, no one’s there.

But only kind of. It’s not so bad that I can’t see a light at the end or that I’ll never smile again. It’s that I’ll probably never get the only thing I ever craved for. That’s terrible actually but I don’t know, shit has a way of always getting worse than it is.

While that undoubtedly sucks, life is about more than that for me. I’m not down 24/7, thank the Lord, so I can’t act like my life is over. Get me not wrong, sometimes it stings really awfully and for long periods too. But there’s an entire world out there beyond my own personal lil one that is fascinating, to use one word to describe life.

I should go back in my head. It was always great every time, I would be my own patter in the back and it worked, it works, because I never let myself down in the sense that I always care.

And it’s not like I want to be babied around either. May not seem like it but I’m a strong person inside, I don’t go down easy and every time I do I never stay there longer than necessary. But even the strongest need a helping hand every now and then and I’ve never had that, not genuinely.

Now is one of those times. And what I needed now isn’t even that big a deal. Just someone who would listen and understand. You’d think that wouldn’t be so hard to find.

Anyway. C’est la vie, cheries. I want to go back and fix myself by myself like I’ve always done but not come back this time. It was only when I came back and hoped that I got bit in the ass. Every single time. But no longer.

I’m smart enough to understand and to move on and to focus elsewhere and to do so many other things this world has to offer that fulfill me. One of the best lessons I learned in life was how to take the L. Accept it, let it go and carry on.

Here’s to hoping",Depression

"my depression keeps getting worse, and i want to stop pushing away the people i love. 20M

I feel like im slowly decaying. My mind slips; i cant remember much anymore, i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore; at least not the ones that ive done already (which is just about everything). I have all the desire in the world to get better, but no motivation. I can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. I noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time, and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. It feels like a disease.

My life just feels like im in limbo every day. I wake up, do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week, then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. At night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks, which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. Its nothing horrifying or disturbing, but they really bother me. Its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose.

The thought that really bugs me the most, the reason for making this post in the first place, tells me to push people away. Not really in that exact manner, but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. Everyone is normally completely fine, but not during my episode. It makes me feel like a completely different person. It makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. Its similar for my friends. Im fine with them normally, but during my episodes, they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. But after i go to sleep and wake up, everything is back to normal. I love my girlfriend, and i like my friends. This thought didnt start happening until this month. I never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends, and i always hated being alone, and i still do; which is how i can tell that im getting worse. Im just not me anymore, im a completely different person than the one i used to know.

The other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future, and general sadness questions. Wondering if im ever going to live a stable life, or if im going to feel happy and content ever again, or if i will continue to be a failure forever. I always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually, and i cant feel like this forever, but most times its hard to convince myself. I cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. Im not suicidal, i dont have a desire to stop living, and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. But these episodes make it really difficult to be a living, functioning person.

I need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. I know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally, but im afraid of them.",Depression

"how did you know that you were/are depressed and not just mentally exhausted or burned out? both depression and mental exhaustion or burnout share a lot of the same things:

\- no energy to do things

\- bad sleep

\- not in the mood to do things

\- a very bad memory and not able to remember things

\- not being capable of having fun because you feel so tired

\- you want to do things but are just not able to do so cause you feel so crappy

\- getting angry or irritated at everything and everyone

how did you know that you were/are depressed and not just mentally exhausted or burned out?

I learned that a depressed person might still want to do things but feel so tired and don't enjoy the things they wanna do or used to enjoy.

i had some kind of medical form with a lot of questions and the result is that i have a very high score on distress and depression, but depression can cause high distress symptoms and high distress can cause depression symptoms.

Anyone who can share some information?

Ps, they claim i am clinically depressed for a few years now but i don't wanna die (i also don't care if i live or die. If i die then so be it).",Depression

"I used to drink almost nightly due to my depression. Recently it has worsened to the point where I literally do not feel have the energy to do anything besides work anymore and its actually terrifying. I went in a backpacking trip this past weekend and while it was amazing, the depression came back ten fold since my return. I have suicidal thoughts *constantly* (i have dealt with them since i was a young child) and I have lost all joy in activities I used to love unless I am on vacation. I have a very bad feeling about this particular depression wave. Normally I begin to feel better after a few days of feeling like this but for the past couple months (except this past weekend) it has been extremely overwhelming. I have had people at work comment on me looking down (including my boss) and even people I have never met (customers) ask me what is wrong when I think I am putting on a decent mask.I am breaking down crying every single day. I used to cope with alcohol but now I literally just lay here completely numb.

"As I write in r/depression. I state my life is fine. I know decent people and I have survived the indecent. I have learned a lot and my life is very decent for a 26 year old black man born in low class society. The worst thing in my life is probably masturbation and with that I am down to like 1 a days. I have goals and dreams. My family is decent enough. I have ladies in my life. I am actually Elevating, I can feel it. I have never gotten the girl I was after, everyone I have wanted I have failed at, so all my loves are circumstantial. I achieve in all but the loves I choose. In that I have still had women, I still achieve the casual sex, and I am about to be a millionaire and I doubt that will hurt my chances and I have even analyzed all my failure and it is made me better in my approach... so yea nothings wrong with me. Failure was never an option because I did not quit. I believe in God and I have beat the suicidal tendencies. there is nothing I dislike more in a game than a quitter. Why r/depression? I feel like life's been an interesting ordeal to say the least but fuck I feel like being a black man on this planet blows. If I had not joined the military in the past I would be fucked on a highway to nowhere right now and it is only getting worse on this planet. I was born 1995 before Gameboy got color and as we evolved through technology it feels to me that we have devolved as beings. Shit, I myself am piece of work and I work hard. It took a lot to be this decent, I literally dealt with years of darkness and still do, but I do not want to kill anyone, or destroy the world... I used to though. Honestly I think everyone is capable of anything if they put their mind to it but you must be willing to continue.Information is key, you have to be willing to grow. You must apply information to effort, no matter how fast or slow. The snail does not know where the fuck it is going and its not even capable of high speeds but that fuckers moving. Being poor, being stagnant, these are mindsets. Set your mind to something else. Knowing your situation is half the battle, the rest is faith baby. The odds of any of this existence bullshit do not exist, infinitesimal. Which means you are already beating the odds. Keep fucking fighting do not quit. This is for me as much as it is for whoever reads.I hope you equalstand... the better you are, the better I am, the better we can be to eachother, that is better people on the planet, making things a slightly better place. it is those who know the darkness that shine the brightest. Be brave. The time is always now. Do with that info what you will. I hope reddit does not remove this. I hope it touches someone.

"I am severely traumatized and in the lowest throes of depression. I could fill a book with experiences that would horrify the average person. It is truly remarkable that I am alive, and life is something that I hate to no end. This is a trigger warning, because even though I would probably despise you, I respect your membership in a ""moral community."" I am going to vent some things that contribute to my depression. do not read it, straight up. To preface, I am not some 14 year old kid struggling with new emotions. I am 31, and I have experienced pretty much exclusively low points throughout my life, interspersed with extensive, mind-destroying misery that nearly killed me several times. I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 99% of humanity is sinister in nature, and wicked in their actions. I hate you, very genuinely. My entire being is consumed by an unquenchable hatred for my fellow human being. I was not always like this, though. I was a nice kid with a big, loving heart, even though my parents were meth head trailer trash. My innocence was systematically stolen from me over the course of my early years. I learned to hate, and I eventually lost my ability to trust other humans on any level. I literally cannot maintain any relationships, and I live in complete isolation, waiting to die. I had early childhood issues with abandonment that made me feel like everyone was going to suddenly leave me. I was not wrong. People are shit, and they will stick around as long as you have something that they want. You, the person reading this, are like this. No matter what you think about yourself, you are not loyal to anyone but yourself, and you probably do not even know it. Only broken people can truly understand the ramifications their actions can have on others, because they were once victimized by another's selfishness - their willingness to use you to attain a need or desire of some kind. In order to *truly* understand that, you have to have experienced trauma. Real trauma. Not ""I got a spanking when I was 10."" The kind that actually fucks you up forever. *trigger warning for people who cannot validate my experience, while simultaneously expecting their own experiences to be validated* You, at the grocery store, staring at my ragged clothes and greasy hair, please go fuck yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your own goddamned business. You, in the car trying to run me off the fucking road while you text on your cell phone, I hope you crash and your car bursts into flames. You, neighbor, slamming your fucking fist on the wall whenever I walk across my house - whenever you do this, I have a panic attack. I imagine gruesome things about you, and all that separates us is a paper thin wall that I could crush through with my bare hands. Fuck you. If you knew my thoughts, you would move. You, the guy who stole my car a couple months back. I hope terrible things happen to you in prison. You, the employer who stole thousands of dollars from me and my employees while I managed your company and literally kept it afloat through 2020, I hope your fucking business goes under and your family goes hungry. Fuck you. I hope your mansion burns down. I could go on forever. I despise you all with all my soul. I just had to say some of this. Keep in mind that I do not care about your feelings, and I do not seek validation. I feel nothing but hatred and sadness.",Depression

"Hello. Lately my mental health has been slowly out of my control. I have been struggling with it for years and still managed to recover or help myself through each episode but now, I think either it is become greater overtime or I am too exhausted to deal with it. Night time used to be my favorite time as this is when I could re-charge myself and feel more inspired. But the last two years, everything has turned up side down. At day time, working keeps my thoughts from wandering to undesirable things. But when I go to bed, I start to feel despair, useless, hopeless,...The scariest thing is, I could cry my eyes out at night and wake up next morning feeling ""hating"" myself being so miserable last night. But then the night comes again, things repeat. Last year there was one time I had shortness of breath and was so close to faint but luckily got myself go to the hospital.. After that and even now sometimes I still have these symptoms especially lying down, like my breath become shorter and lighter... I have not gone to the therapist yet. I have talked about this to my close friends but the thing is, when those episodes do not hit, I act very normally and cannot describe exactly what is going on with me. Every time I tried to seek advise about my problems but then my ""common sense"" is like ""no you are just exaggerating things, get a rest and you will be fine"". I am not fine at all.

I have zero motivation to get anywhere in life, I have no interests that are worth putting time and effort into to better myself.

"I am still depressed but I am overall improving. Ever since I overdosed on some pills I have finally found out why pills are the scariest thing you could die from. it is painless and takes up to 3 hours to kick in.

I sometimes feel like a burden to people, that feeling has not gone away. But I hope someday I will be as happy as a normal person.

My other friend (let us name him P) reach out to our friend group and said J has been ghosting us. Which is true, J has been rarely responding us even tho we reach out him. He said hes been overthinking a lot, his anxiety has been rising, and he needs time alone. Cut off from social media and everything. I understand and comply with his wish.However, there is something that is been bothering me with what P said. P suggests we should distance him, and show disappointment and negative emotions towards him. P believes that if we comply with him, it will only make him take granted for what we are doing and become selfish. Basically what P wants is that he wants J to know his behavior are cowardly and disrespectful to people around him, and that he should not ghost, rather confront us.I do not know what to do. Should we just leave him alone and let him figure it out. Or we make him learn that he should not ghost, but by harsh approach. Taking initiative and confronting him is also possible, but I do not know the right timing. If you have any other approaches, Ill gratefully listen to it.

"I am not really sure if this is normal or what, but literally all I can ever seem to think about is how useless I am. I think it is slowly making me go crazy, or something. I am already so insecure and all the people around me seem to be so much more intelligent than I am. I used to be smart, but around a few years ago, everything just started to feel less and less real, and so I just had much less incentive to care, and so less reasons to find things to think deeply about. Now, all I can think about is how much more everyone else around me has accomplished. I genuinely do not understand how people think normally on a day-to-day basis. Is this normal, and am I just making it a bigger deal than it actually is? Regardless of what I am doing, somehow I always find a way to feel terrible about myself about it. Like, for example, if I am watching a show, I will feel like I am not ""enjoying it right"", and that I am interpreting the show wrong and that I am not enjoying it in the same way everyone else is.

I reconnected with an old junior high friend and we have been 'seeing eachother' for a few months now. it is not official, and we live 3 hours from eachother, so we do not get to see eachother often. The past few months, my job has been increasingly more stressful. Way more than what I feel is necessary for a medical Secretary. The professionals I work for are cruel and cold, and nothing is ever enough. The office management keeps piling work on us and tells us to just work overtime to get it done. they have taken our lunch breaks away, so most days I am stuck in my chair for 9-12 hours. My back hurts, my eyes hurt and I am constantly battling a headache. I am never good enough. The only reason I have left is that I am moving back to my home town in October, so I want to push through. I have also been with the company longer than most other secretaries, with more experience than them and they make more that me. Salty at that.Money is also so tight right now I had to cancel my health insurance and all of my extra benefits through work. But dealing with work, the weight gain, which is terrifying, missing my unofficial boyfriend and home, I also just found out that my ex-husband got remarried last week. there is a 6 month wait period in Missouri from divorce to remarry and he hit it on the nose. I am not sure what my feelings are about this, but it is weighing on me. I do not want to be with him. He cheated/lied about cheating, would gas light, and if I would ever stand my ground, I would get hit, then he would call the police and tell them I attacked him and started hitting myself 'to blame him'. I am so relieved to be out of that situation, but finding out that he got married again (to someone 15 years younger than him) really bothers me. Like I get the marriage was garbage, but to move on so quickly just floors me. I am not sure how long he is been with this girl, but since our divorce, he is had about 5 girlfriends, and she is the newest one. His last relationship ended mid May. I only know all this because our mutual friends find it necessary to tell me, which that is a whole ordeal on its own. I also still have to deal with him because of a joint loan for a car. He has the car, the title is in his name, but he refuses to refinance it to take my name off. I know I rambled on alot, but I just feel like every aspect of my life is crap right now and I cannot find a way to break myself out of this funk. I sleep more, have trouble getting up, and actually making myself look decent. I have no desire to work, workout, eat regularly or healthily and I do zero self care. I told myself last night that today would be different, and it was but for the worse. I woke up and called into work and went back to sleep for another 3 hours. Finally got up and had a protein shake and then made sure to get some veggies in with lunch, but I am so low on energy, I feel like I am slipping away. I have not had any kind of suicidal or self harm thoughts, just extreme thoughts of worthlessness.Anyone experience anything similar or have thoughts to help break out of this funk?

"I do not even know where to start.. Or even what to say, I am that overwhelmed by what I have been feeling the past 2 weeks, I am at my lowest point I have ever been, cannot go 10 minutes without crying, cannot get out of bed, cannot sleep (averaging 2-3 hours a day, with sedatives from my psychiatrist), I just want this damn pain to end, I cannot keep living like this, I do not have the power to keep putting that damn fake smile on, and there is not one person I have in my whole life I can talk to about this, they do not understand how frustrating and agonizing it is living like this, and the only person that made me fell wanted, ever, does not want anything to do with me anymore, and I do not blame her, I am too much even for myself, I should not even try to be in a relationship, I am not well enough, or at all, and after countless therapy sessions and pills, I do not think I will ever be.I do not want to end it, but living like this..

let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life,Depression
"The person who smiles at you and tells you how great their life is, probably feels similar to you. Many people experience sexual, verbal or physical abuse. The person you are so jealous of could be a day away from suicide. I cannot promise anyone here anything, but you might as well post your story here. If no one replies, they are probably in a similar situation and scared to give you advice.Many people who commit suicide immediately regret it and try to save themselves. This is why it is so difficult to drown yourself because your body literally will fight your brain about killing yourself. Not to mention the fact that people end up mentally retarded or other physically handicaps from suicide. it is NOT THE ANSWER!!!!! if you are reading this DO NOT COMMIT SUICIDE.",Depression
So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21-year-old black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer.

"i have booked a greyhound bus to go to Dallas, Texas next month so i can easily get another bus ticket next month to go to fresno, california so i can be with my boyfriend next month which i plan on staying with him because he wants to see me and i do too. the only problem is where i would stay out in dallas, texas because i am traveling from atlanta, georgia to get to dallas texas because i don;t know anybody or how much a hotel will cost. i plan on taking another bus to get from dallas, texas to go to dallas texas but the only thing is i do not know what it means when it says change buses because i do not know if getting on the next bus will take me to where i need to be because i hate to get lost is why my mom wish i had someone with me in case i get lost but also that i would be safe. the only way i can get from my city in georgia to get to Atlanta, Georgia is to take a lyft because i have no family, friends or no way of getting there so i have to do what i go to do. i wish i had help for real which i will not when i get to dallas, texas because i am a special needs person so i have a hard time understanding, comprehending very well and when it comes to asking questions i am afraid of me sounding weird or it coming out stupid because i am a very anxious and shy person which is why it is hard for me to do some things on my own or when it comes to asking for help or the thought if i had to transfer 2 or 3 times will make it hard because if i get lost i will end up getting very anxious, start panicking and crying which is why i took one bus at a time which is one to get to atlanta, georgia to dallas texas and then buy another ticket when i get there to get me to fresno, california but 1 transfer seems alot easy so i do not get confused because i do not know if they will tell me when or if i have to transfer ot not because i have a hard time with things because i am a slow learner. I wish I can make a friend before going to Dallas, Texas before then so that way I will have help or will not get lost because I am thinking of buying another Bus ticket to get from dallas, Texas to Fresno California to see my boyfriend but I do not think I can afford a hotel and bus too but also do not feel safe having my phone out in public with people around that something bad can happen because it is just too much transferring which will get me confusing and lost! I hope everything works out so I would need everyone is support! I got to figure out about where to stay when I get to dallas, Texas the 4th of august and I have a suitcase so I hope I can bring that on there to take on the bus but if everything works out I will put a update on here! I have high anxiety right now doing this but I got to somehow do what is right! I really miss my boyfriend and I hope I can be with him is the reason I am always depressed, anxious and he really wants me there so I make sure I can do everything I can to go be with him and I really have no friends that is going to help get me to him so I had to think of something but the think when I get to Texas I feel I cannot afford a hotel but also a bus from Dallas, Texas to Fresno California because I have no long distance friends from anywhere like that who could possibly follow things through with me to help me so I do not get lost! I have been in a long distance relationship with him for a while now and I am hoping I can get to him I just want to cry right now because my anxiety and depression is going through the roof, I overthink a lot and I just feel alone where I have no friends or nobody but a part of me does not know how to start a conversation or good with words is why I feel nobody sticks around because I am way too anxious and shy but I am afraid of being ghosted and hurt is all I get but it would be better if I was there with my boyfriend!

"I have not had any goals in life since I was a kid. I have worked low-level jobs just to pay the bills and after high school have not gone to school. Every day I wake up thinking what is the point to get up and go to work just to stay alive when in fact I just want to die and never work towards anything. Well that all changed a while ago. After months of sick leave I went back to work and at first I thought I will just work so maybe one day I will afford to get an education in a field I am interested in. I am not into anything really so that thought went down the drain. Then I thought that I have always wanted to travel to the Northern parts of Norway and Sweden but never had the time, energy nor money. I realized I do not have any occupations besides work and my mental health. So, I decided that I will work my ass of as well as I manage to save some money so that next summer I will be able to take a four week trip to North. it is not going to be easy but at least, for the first time in years, I have some type of a goal and a reason to get up and go to work.

"I have been dealing with depression from my teenage years and got prescribed medication when I was 12. I was living with my grandma at that point and she thought I was tricking the doctor and was proud of me for doing such a good job at appearing sad. I was not faking it. My family were never big on mental health and its only recently that I got to discuss it with my mom. I am in college now and have been going to therapy for the past 2 years. Therapy is fine. I mostly attended the sessions when I was not having an episode, so basically, I have not attended one in the past 6 months. I mentioned how I started being more open with my mother about how I was feeling, she helped me pay for a trip to visit a friend. I was there for a month, helped a lot. I was ok for the two weeks after I got home and now- Its back to square 0. I feel ungrateful. I had a chaotic childhood growing up and it made sense how I was feeling then. It does not make sense how I am feeling now. I am surrounded by people I care for and doing the job I love, studying the shit I could give my life for. But instead- I waste my time, either eating or sleeping because they are the only two things I have energy for. Getting off my bed to go play a f- videogame is the highlight of my day. I have friends inviting me to go out, but looking at myself in the mirror, I do not think anyone should see me at this point. I cannot see myself, so why do I expect others. This is not how people know me. I am a workaholic. I am an extrovert. The friendly person that cleans up, helps, and does shit to make my mom proud. Right now, I am just an ungrateful, disappointment of a child. This has been written after two hours of banging my head against any surface, crying for someone to make it stop. I feel like a disappointment",Depression

I have never really reached out for help before but I was scared that I was getting close to ending my life. it is all I was thinking of. I am told I will have to wait two years for counselling.

"Internally induced vs externally induced depression?  

This is a pretty ignorant question but is there a distinction between internally induced and externally induced depression?

For instance internally would be those cases where your neurochemicals just betray you, you're moving through life just fine then suddenly you're bedridden with catatonic depression and only after being heavily medicated can you function.

Externally would be a concatenation of failures or disappointments or miseries which blacken your view of humanity and existence itself to the point that you no longer see the good in people or the joy in experiences and eventually an reach a point where you're also dysfunctional and need to be medicated.

Has anyone experienced the former?",Depression

Since 2018, I have been working as a part-time student advisor making less than $20k annually as I was very undecided about the direction my life was going to go and it was like this for 2 years until I decided to return to college to take prerequisite courses for graduate school so that I can get into a data science graduate program. 

I'm currently in my program right now and I have been keeping a 4.0 GPA and this gives me a lot of hope but I've noticed that some of my friends (including my love interest) make much more money than I do and have their own places. My love interest told me that I will eventually get out of my situation and we still had very passionate sex when I last visited him and we exchanged our gratitudes for each.

But its like, I'm very disappointed at myself for allowing myself to be where I am today.

"Hey everyone. I am currently 21 and was diagnosed with GAD and PTSD about 2 years ago. that is just from my therapist after about 2 months of sessions. I am never really able to open up to people, especially those with some type of authority or the people you are supposed to trust. I never mentioned all of my trauma because I feel like I am not really ready to deal with it. The important people I opened up to refuse believe me and think I am lying or exaggerating. I am not a liar though, my abuser lied to my parents about me and they believed him because he was the adult in charge (he was a coach). Even to this day they see how much has come out about him and they refuse to believe anything serious happened (I think its their own guilt so I get it but still). Nobody took the time to actually see me and try to help before I became an adult. I have a lot of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD. I do not really know if there is more but there is this feeling that there is just because its hard to open up about pain, trauma, or even when a doctor asks questions like have you been feeling down or anxious. I have no idea how to answer that other than not much more than normal.Is there any way I can get a gauge on my feelings or being able to more accurately describe my feelings for a realistic picture on my mental health. Not knowing about my mental health sucks, especially when its hard to pen up to the people you are supposed to.",Depression
"I used to be okay. That is until I got hooked to anti-anxiety medication. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has changed the course of my life.Nowadays I see the world differently. I used to feel part of it. I used to feel like I had a place here. Lately I have felt like an outsider. Like I do not belong. I see people with their morning routines and just think I wish I had some structure like them. I do not have structure. I feel like an alien. Every single person I know has some sort of structure. I do not. I went from feeling like water inside a cup, to water being thrown out onto the street. My life was okay on Benzos. I could function without much anxiety. But I saw the writing on the wall. I was addicted to them. I could not do much without them, but when I was on them I was carefree, risk-taking and relatively happy. A lot of good happened in my life. I got married, was doing well at work and finally felt free from my anxiety. Something Id dealt with since I was young. From ages 24-28, I was under the influence of Xanax or Klonopin. Little did I know, with every dose, I was screwing my brain up. With ever-increasing dosages, my doctor eventually stopped prescribing them - after 3 1/2 years. I was at a high dose of 4mg Klonopin. Early this year is when my life was turned upside down when my prescription was cut off. I did not think much of it. Until a few days later when my body started shaking and I got violently sick. I did not know what was happening, neither did my wife. I started googling benzo withdrawal and found this subreddit and concluded that it was in fact the klonopin. 6 months later, I am at a lower dose (.5mg). I should feel accomplished. I should feel like I am making progress, but in fact I feel defeated. I am so tired. I am so worn out. I barely sleep and I am anxious all day. I am terrified of the real world. I have zero confidence in myself. I feel like a total loser. I could cry ever single day. I do not know what is wrong with me. If I had known that Id suffer this way due to Klonopin, I would have told the doctor to shove it down his own throat. This has taken my dignity, my will to continue and my confidence for the future.

"And it did not even feel genuine. I want to cry, like, really bad. I just want to cry. I want to be able to express myself, but there is no one else to express myself to. So lonely.I started working out recently, and have been trying to find motivation through doing so. I get through everything but at the end I just feel a wave of dissatisfaction. Why? Like, cannot I just feel something other than disappointment and self-hatred for once. I think this passing few months my mental health has taken a nosedive. I have thought about ways to kill myself and I have planned out scenarios in my mind in intricate details I never thought I would be able to. I am too scared to go through with any of them because I do not want to make my parents sad, but if I died right here right now of some freak accident out of my control I am down for it. Yeah, last time I cried I remember it was not even tears rolling down the eyes. It was not genuine. It was more sympathy than anything. This sucks, I think I can change sometimes but I never do. Nothing has changed for the better these past 3 years. The only time I cried was 4 years ago",Depression

"My mum and me had a physical fight/argument last night and I'm scared Throw away account for this. Myself M15 almost turning 16 had a fight with my mum yesterday and it got physical. I can't exactly remember who hit first but it got to the point that hands were on one another and spitting was involved. My mum had been charged 50 dollars for something on her credit card and I had asked her to buy something for 10 dollars. It turns out the currency was off on the thing I wanted to purchase. She then bought it up to me and to me it seemed like she was yelling. I have always been quite sensitive to yelling and I always take it really personally. After we had the conversation, mid way through I went to my room and locked it so I could breath because I was really stressed out. She then came from the living room into my room, bashing the door open and breaking my lock, breaking my door as well, it fell of the hinge. She came into my room while I was crying and was yelling at me. I told her to get out with swearing involved because I was really stressed out and upset. She then wouldn't and she kept getting right up into my face as if she was going to start throwing hands at me. I then was starting to involve talks of myself going to hurt myself, she then said that she doesn't know what I was on about and got really defensive. I then said can you just give me 5 minutes to breath and then I will come speak with her, after going back and forward for about 15 minutes she finally left me alone and I shut my door and dragged my dresser in front of it. I then had a full on panic attack for a solid 15 minutes and I could barely breath and I was smacking my head onto my wall and on my desk. She then came back to my room after she had sit in the lounge and listen to it all happen while she was sitting there watching TV. She came back and was back into a calm state herself which is quite a normal thing for her and she came in my room and comforted me. I kept breaking into tears while she was talking to my cat. After the situation she calmed me down after about 30 minutes of a continued panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I feel really scared still, although she said that she was sorry for it. I still feel really scared to be around her and I feel really sick after she spat on me and I am hurting still really bad after she hit me.

"Support and advice greatly needed (26 year old female) sorry for the long post… I’ve been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft &amp; then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018, but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often &amp; have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that’s when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I’ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn’t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so I’m thinking it’s a medication issue or lack of something. I’m mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since I’m not doing well lol.

"I have been struggling with depression for 8 years now. I used to be worse, where I would cut myself and it even got to the point where I was ready to kill myself. I had the pills ready. (Sorry if reading about self-harm or suicide upsets anyone.) Anyways. I actually was able to lift myself out of everything for a while, I got a boyfriend and I am still with him, it is been nearly 3 years now. I have just started university and here I am again, I have been resisting the urge to drink myself blind, cut myself, or even kill myself. I have become a boring, negative loser. My 2 friends are worried about me, I can tell, but I am pushing them away. Why am I pushing them away? I have no idea. I am lashing out at them whenever they ask me if I am alright. I have even gone back to putting up fake happiness in front of my boyfriend so he does not suspect a thing. I do not think he will suspect a thing. Just last night we were talking and his replies were ""yeah"", ""okay"", ""mmm"". he is just a lazy replier but it does not help with my new wave, if that is what you can call it, of depression that is just hitting me. I asked him if I was boring him and he said sort of. Somehow I convinced myself that he was holding back on going nuts about how boring I am. Then I began to think, 'he must think I am extremely boring, my friends do too but they feel obligated to check on me since I am always checking on them.' I feel like such a damn burden, I have been crying myself to sleep. The moment my head hits the pillow, I finally feel relaxed. Even typing this I just have a disgusting lump in my throat that I cannot get rid of. I just do not know what to do. I do not open up to people when I have my own issues, but I am always ready to hear their issues. I only feel alright about putting this on reddit because I do not know you guys; and maybe some of you will understand how I feel? What should I do? it is getting worse everyday and I am scared I will resort to cutting again, or worse. Sorry btw, if this is all over the place. My mind is in shambles.

"This shit always be coming in waves. One day I feel happy and I think, there was absolutely nothing wrong with me lol I was so dramatic, and boom comes the weeks of depression and being angry with everything and everyone. Being out of control with my emotions but feeling empty and numb at the same time. I cannot sleep, and then I cannot wake up. When I finally fall asleep I can stay there forever. When I am down, I do not WANT to get better. I roll my eyes at all that you need to be POSITIVE, its a mindset crap. I do not care. But when I am okay, I am advocating for that and motivated to improve my life. I think I am constantly in the middle of self improvement and self destruction. I do not want to go out anymore or see other people, and sometimes I feel all the relationships I have around me are all fake. My friends probably secretly hate me and look down on me. My boyfriend probably thinks those girls in porn are much prettier and better than me. I am the failure of the family with no good career, money, or knowledge of the world. I cannot talk stocks and policies like my brother. And I have nothing I am really good at either. I can learn but I have no motivation either. My family will think I am an idiot anyways that is how its always been. I often find myself wanting to restart. Have a clean slate, everything is brand new and I feel normal. But I do not have the resources or willpower for that. And sometimes I just wish I never existed, I wish I can disappearessentially die without the pain and consequences on others around me. After a decade now being depressed on and off, I realize that I should probably try some medication. I have been weary of trying it but probably its worth a shot? Sometimes I convince myself to forgive the people that have hurt me. I tell myself its time to move on. But the next minute I am filled with rage again and I do not know why I cannot let it go.

My own dishonesty about how deep this runs has just been coming up a lot lately. I’m just always looking at the clock for time to pass, for oblivion to enter. I cannot stand existing, maybe that’s called depression, with other issues included, that just don’t seem worth solving at this point. So I’m just wondering, how is your life?

I have struggled with self-hate ever since I was kid. I believe that nobody could, can, or ever will love me, including myself. There just really is not much to like. Not soon after it became depression and I have just lived my life like this. I am married and have 2 kids. Just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. Being depressed (as my doctor explained) is usually from outward influences. Depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. But yeah, it does not get better with time like everybody says, I have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. Really, I have no idea what I want to say. I guess if you struggle with depression, please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. You may think that those things will help you (I did) but they do not. Instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. Anyway, I recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. It was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. And I am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again, but I am waging a war with myself. Get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. Personally the latter seems like the better option but then I think about what it would do to him in the future. Would he really think I loved him and did it for him, or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? So I am getting help instead. There is so much more I want to say about having depression and being a mother, but it will literally be a book and nobody wants to read that, so yeah. It sucks, but get help.

I had to go to therapy but I only had 2 sessions because I could not afford it. But I am mostly better with that, although I still have my days. I will return to therapy once I get a full time job again and can hopefully afford it.So yeah -- I just started crying in the restaurant because it overwhelmed me with memories (same restaurant but different location). Guess I am still not over him. I have not tried to date since, I am not even interested in meeting anyone.

"I (17M) have been diagnosed with Aspergers, although my experiences are better described as high functioning autism (although I do not function at all lol), a semi-official type of Autism. Luckily, my autism was recognised very early in my life, when I was about 3/4 years old. I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (later with Aspergers). Because of my amazing parents who fought very hard for me to get the help I needed, I got special training in primary school. I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my ""explosions"", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends. However, this training had an unintended consequence, I was convinced that the only way to be accepted in society was to isolate myself when it all got too much for me. This does not always work out, and afterwards I feel really guilty, especially if it happens around people I love, because I see it leaves an impact on them. It also does not really help that I am constantly irritated, because of the pandemic, lack of sleep and maybe depression?I feel so guilty for being such an asshole, my friends and family do not deserve it, it is also the reason I feel like I do not deserve their love. Does anyone have similar experiences and/or advice how to convince myself I am worthy of love? I would really love to hear your thoughts I feel like I do not deserve love",Depression

"I think I may be depressed. I just cannot get out of bed, I have nothing to do outside of it. I have been isolated from friends for almost 4 years, I have only internet friends now. I do not have a job since I am underage, I do not have friends to go out with and I do not have pets to walk. I have been having thoughts about not existing and how that would be better than living life and dealing with responsibilities or people (not suicide, just disappearing). I cannot get up to exercise, to go out, and I will always postpone everything the hardest I can (I have not cut my hair in 2 years, which I have never done before) and if I have the option to stay home instead of going out, I will stay home. Also, sometimes I feel like I am just a spectator and not the protagonist of my life. I feel so indifferent about some things, and sometimes it seems like I am just watching a movie or playing a game. here is the catch: I am not sad. I do not experience long periods of sadness, I do not cry at night, I do not even feel down, I am either happy or neutral (happy most of the time), and sometimes only the thought of living fills me with joy. I have never seen it as depression, and thought it was a phase, but not getting out of bed for a week straight does not seem normal for a healthy 17yo. Does someone relate? Have you seen this? Am I not depressed and making this up? Maybe I am just super lazy? What the fuck is wrong with me??? Depression without sadness?",Depression

I do not want to call it depression because sometimes I am good and do not have these thoughts but I think this subreddit fits me the best.I thought that moving into a house from a tiny one bedroom would help me. There were too many bad memories there and the tiny size just left me feeling there is no way to escape. I ended up moving into a larger house 3+ bedrooms and it is just me and my son (on weekends).I thought moving location would help but now that I am in this house I just realize even more how alone I am. When it is just me here I look around and it is like my loneliness is hitting me in the face. Right now I am struggling because I have been separated with my son's mother because we had issues. Even so, I love her so much and being apart kills me inside. We have been separated for a while but we at least still talked and hung out. We had a fight and ever since then we have not been right. I want to be with her but she said she is not sure what she wants but is certain that she does not want a relationship at this moment. I totally understand that and do not want to force anything but it is hard going to like zero interaction with her and then the small amounts of time I do see her when she picks up our son or I drop him off. A few times in my life I have thought about killing myself and luckily always got through. I am trying hard to stay on the positive side but lately thoughts creep into my head about doing it again. I will look around to see what could support my weight to hang myself, I think about doing the running car in the garage thing, or even just buying a gun. I end up shaking my head and brushing those thoughts away but they are becoming more frequent and I am just scared that the amount of time that I have alone with myself that one time I will not brush it aside.

"TL;DR: I feel like I caused my best friends death and my entire life crashed around me, now I do not want it anymore. I guess Ill just start from the beginning. Ill speed this up though because I do not want to take up too much of your time. In like 6th or 7th grade I made friends online playing overwatch with a dude, like really good friends. I never had a buddy I could talk to casually and safely about literally anything from after school until 4am. We used to have a joke where wed just tell each other do not be a bitch for advice. It was laughable, really it was, because we both knew each other would give real advice anyway. Those would end up being my most hated words ever.Back in April of this year, I had a decently healthy relationship with a gf I had for about 6 months, and got accepted into college and was graduating High School. My friend and I started FaceTiming and he started to drive. He told me he should stop and I told him to not be a bitch. We told each other jokes and laughed really hard. He turned to look at me for a brief moment, looked back at the road, and got in an accident. His head went through the windshield and he died instantly. I panicked, and I do not usually do that. I felt enormous guilt, I still do. What had happened I felt was my fault entirely. So much so that I promised that it would never happen again. I left my gf and all of my closest friends for their safety. That was the hardest decision of my life. They all tried to get me to stop but i did not listen. I played Minecraft with my now dead friends little brother, he must have been 7-8 years old. I have never heard a kid cry like that. I did not even have the balls to tell him what happened or that I was sorry for it. Flash forward to about a few weeks ago, I tried overdosing on pills. Obviously that did not work, I guess I am inept? But I visited my grandparents house, started going through some old stuff. I found my grandpas old pistol and held it up. It just seemed like the right thing to do. I could not do that either. I wussed out. I have tried drinking to forget or maybe honor my lost friend(s) but nothing works. I cannot sleep. I guess I am asking for help but honestly maybe I do not deserve it. I am sorry for writing so much, maybe I just needed to get this off my chest. I am sorry My best friend died and its my fault",Depression
"I do not know what to do, I have a creative mind and I enjoy making various forms of media but I have a lot of projects I want to do. I have written a few animated TV shows, they are both based on some part of my depression but I have no faith that my ideas will ever see the light of day, I have ideas for games that I want to make, while they are simple I have no one to bounce off of and I have no idea what I am doing in the process. One could argue that I could just animate and produce my projects my self, but that is easier said than done. And for the video game stuff, people could argue that I should just look up tutorials for everything I want to do but the thing is tutorials do not exist for everything I want to do, at this point I just need to suck it up and learn everything possible about the coding program but its so much time, So much time that is already taken up by bigger priorities.All of this hurts, I have gotten to the point where I genuinely believe that I will never see my ideas come to light.

"[Trigger warning] This is mostly based on the fact that my mom always wanted me and my siblings to go to the curch but I was the most sensitive one.I do not have any friends so I did not talk about it with anybody but my mom but I cannot do that anymore.Three years ago I confessed for the first time that I tought God was evil and they told me to pray for things to change.Three years later I have always been praying with the same feelings and now I cannot even think about God without feeling hatred and despair.When I was a kid my mom always tried to get me to go to the Orthodox curch and fast. Three years ago I was having problems sleeping due to my growth and my mom told me it was because I did not come to the curch with her.I got really scared.Basically being scared was the only reason I believe in God and why I am doing so badly.Now I was scared of more than not sleeping ,I was scared I will go to hell and that God will punish me for the tiniest bad tought.I even got a tic in my mind I say ""forgive me God"",I was not alowed to sleep more than 6 h ,to eat fully or without praying and I prayed more than 1 h and did 50/100 prostrations and reading everyday ,fasted for half a year every year, I slimmed up 20 kilograms and got sick, and after a long period I have had an operation to remove my colecist.I was extremely stressed out everyday, not to make a single sin and do everything right.Now cannot go to curch anymore and I want God to dessapear and to live a paceful life but I fear I cannot.I want this to end, be it depression or anything else.I am hurting myself and cry every single day for the same reason for a year and my mom does not really want me going to a therapist nor to get medicine.Sometimes my family makes fun of me and over all does not care.I do not have any friends and I do not know what I will do with my life.My mom now blames me saying that I was a fool back then but I was just a child and she were so prowd of me back then. She was saying that God had blessed her. I have never seen my mom so happy and proud and now that I am not trying to do everything right she started to scolds me again and I felt so bad.Recently she admited she had mistaken but she still makes so many of those twisted assumptions about me and thinks suffering it is my fault for having a bad temper.All these Years I have been doing whatever her and my father told me (my father was knoun for baing the weirdest and most insufferable one; when I was arownd 13 he told me I may become a slut because I was having impure toughts and that gave me so much suffering for all these years,now he died and my mom still thinks he was a saint but thinking about him is like thinking about hell)All these years I prayed that I will love God and I ended up hating God.I do not really want to make up with God.I tried but things only got worse every timeI cannot help but blame my mom because I always believed in her worlds weather I wanted or not.Even now it is the same.She is very confident and her belief is everything there is for her.She told me everything there is wrong about humans and life and it gave me depression because everything was bad and everyone was wrong. She also believes stuff that hurts me like ""it is the fault of the damn feminists that womans suffer these days working and the families have been destroyed"" and tells me there is no hapiness on earth nor something worthy of your time other than going to heaven.I do not want to go to heaven ,I just want a paceful life.But what can I do and where can I go to escape God?Everything normal people do is a bigger or smaller sin and I cannot stop thinking about all my mom had told me and I believed.Everything comes into my head :how if you are making a mistake God will give you punishments for you to wake up and come to the right path.And if you do not then that is your fault for going to hell where there will be fire 10000 hotter and if you are debauched bugs will eat you alive forever and there is guilt fear and dispair, and crows eating the belly and chest of women whom aborted children forever and ever.What can a therapist do about that though?I do not know if my family is bad, my dad is disinterested but my mom never let me believe that God can be interpreted in any other way,and I am scared to do it.She also thinks that God is all loving but the fear of God is the first love.she will make fun of other people who do not have the same beliefs as her and I hate that.She also thinks that I am genuinely a bad person and that I have to change.I do not think she is ok with me not being perfect, she tells me ""if you behave like that you will end up in a hell hole in life, nobody is going to be good with you"".She wants me to always forgive ,she always tells me a story with a woman who confessed she was getting bitten by her husband and the father told her to keep water in her mouth all day(so she would shut up).She wants me to accept life is trash and be humble and kind no mather what, sometimes she just tells me I do not understand and that is why I feel like this is bad...

"Obviously, loss of interest/pleasure in once-enjoyable activities is a huge part of depression. In fact, it is one of the hallmark signs that doctors look for when searching for a diagnosis. What I am asking about today is similar to that aspect of the major suck-fest that is living with depression, but a little bit different. What happens to me is that I suddenly feel like doing something that I usually enjoy is actually making me feel MORE depressed. Now, when I say suddenly, I do not mean in a relatively short period of time, like over the course of a couple of days, or even hours or minutes, I mean SUDDENLY. Instantaneously. I will give an example scenario here, because I am not sure how else to really give a clear explanation of this stupidity. Okay, so, I love interior design, I have since I was a child. I love every aspect of it. I love creating floor plans and perspective drawings, I love making presentation boards with every last detail represented, I love watching interior design shows, I love garnering inspiration and learning how to use new design methods and techniques, and I LOVE going to home decor and furniture stores. Even if I am not buying or even looking for anything in particular, I can spend literal hours just combing every aisle. it is my kid in a candy shop setting, 100%. So a couple of days ago, I had some errands to run, and I decided to stop by HomeGoods while I was out, just to poke around. If I am not feeling well, giving myself a field trip to a good home dcor spot will usually have me feeling like myself again in a jiffy. I got ready and left the house feeling relatively upbeat and excited for my upcoming treat. I ran around and got my errands done first, to avoid feeling like I would had dessert without finishing my vegetables. Feeling like I earned whatever treat I give myself, and knowing I do not have anything else I should be doing instead, makes it 100x more enjoyable. I parked the car, hopped out, and pretty much frolicked through the front door like a big old goofball, heading straight to the bathroom department in search of a new shower curtain, because I actually do need one for my downstairs bathroom. As soon as I stopped in front of the display, though, I felt an extremely dramatic shift in my disposition. Just a few seconds ago, I had been really happy, in my zone. Suddenly, though, staring at all the pretty shower curtains felt like the last thing in the whole world I wanted to do. All I could think was, This is stupid. Why am I even here? I turned a slow circle, scanning the rest of the store to see if I could spot anything that might reignite my vigor of a few moments earlier. The more I saw, though, the more bleak and dismal everything seemed. It felt as though a black mist had descended, surrounding me, as well as filling me with a bitter, defeated, heavy sadness. I took a couple of deep, stabilizing breaths, but they did not help. My eyes began to sting, and I knew I had to get out of there before I started inexplicably bawling in front of a store full of people. Feeling as though I had just lost something intangible but meaningful, I slowly and dejectedly made my way out of the store with my eyes trained on the floor. This is typically how this phenomenon usually plays out for me, though it sometimes happens in other ways, as well. Sometimes I will feel great while I shower, dress, and do my hair and makeup, but as soon as I am all ready to go, I do not feel like doing whatever it was anymore. Like I said before, it actually feels like the absolute last thing I want to do. Sometimes it happens right away, as soon as I think of something I want to do. I will think, I would really like to go take pictures in the woods, and start to get excited by the idea, but then, in a fraction of a second, that excitement is replaced by a crushing sadness in response to the same idea. So, yeah, the best way I can explain it is just that something I normally love to do gets flipped upside down in my mind, and my beloved activity now feels like it is actually a part of the problem. It begins to feel like a source of depression and anxiety. To the extent that, if someone asked me, what is causing you to feel unhappy right now? I would reply, the thought of doing something I absolutely love, that is what is making me feel shitty right now. I do not understand why this happens to me, but I am so sick of it. I am just so indescribably tired of the things I usually use to help myself feel better begin to only make me feel worse. it is so mean of my brain to do this to me, and I cannot seem to find a way to make it stop. In fact, it just happens more and more often as time goes by. Does anyone else experience this, or anything like it? If so, what have you done about it? Also, does anyone have a medical or scientific explanation for why this happens? This Suddenly Sucks",Depression
I hate looking in the mirror so much. I do not really know why. I do not exactly like how I look but I do not think I am ugly either. But every time I look in the mirror everything is so off. I do not like what I see. It just feels wrong. it is gotten to the point where I actively close my eyes or look away from mirrors.

"Hey you all,I have depression and social anxiety since I was 16 and just recently came to the decision to try antidepressants, because suicidal thought accured way more often than usual. So I am now on mirtazapine and escitaloptam since about two weeks ago.I played escitalopram once and used like three times the dosage, because I was curious how it would affect me and damn, I thought I would die to serotonin syndrom Anxiety is way better now but depression is definetly worse and I feel a little bit like just watching everything as if I would do stuff automatically. But nothing I have not already read online. I try to cope that by playing guitar or by doing selfcare days, but it is quit exhausting tho.Does anybody who is experienced with antidepressants have some advices or could tell me what to expect from the whole process?Thankfull for every helpfull comment or interesting thought whatsoever :) I am new to antidepressants",Depression

"My brother has been struggling with suicidal thoughts since March of this year. Before confiding in me, he had been seeing a therapist and had not gotten any better. He was struggling to sleep at night so I slept with him every night for two months. I let him vent to me, he cried in my arms and Id wait for him to fall asleep before I did. Unfortunately I had to put my life on pause for all of this so that I can help him out as much as I can. After multiple failed suicide attempts, I decided to Baker Act him for three days until I found a facility that could house and treat him. While hospitalized, he was put on antidepressants and has continued taking them since then. After he was released from the hospital I had him stay in a treatment facility for about a month. He stopped sleeping there but he continued to go the facility every weekday for about six to eight hours. After receiving treatment from this place for a few months, he says he has not gotten any better. Since the start of all this he has become so heartless and cold towards me. He told me the only reason hes alive is because killing yourself is very difficult and hes failed every time. I begged him to promise me he will not try again and he says he cannot make that promise. I love him more than I can put into words, and every time I tell him that he does not say it back. I feel like I have tried everything I can. I am desperate. I do not know what to do. Apart of me feels like its time I take a step back because maybe I am being overbearing and I need to let him figure this out on his own. This has taken so much of a toll on me that I have had to seek therapy, as well. I do not know what more I can do to help him. My 19 year old brother is suicidal and I am desperate to help him.",Depression

"ThrowawayIm female, 20 years old. Ever since I was 12 I have been on antidepressants, antipsychotics for severe depression and anxiety. My parents are divorced since I was 2. they have both been in relationships after. I have lived with my mother and majority of my life its just been us two living together. My brother lived with my father. My mother was in a relationship when I was 11. We moved in with him. He abused her mentally and physically. I heard everything. I saw the scars. Fast forward a few years later she dated another guy. I had met this guy before, we lived with him when I was around 7. It did not last. Last year we got a call that he had hung himself. My father does not understand mental illness. He often calls me a baby or a child and tells me to just suck it up. That its all in my head. My one and only serious relationship was with a boy online. It started when I was 14. Went on and off since I was 17. He said he would come to Canada and marry me. We would have an amazing life together and have kids of our own. I was so happy. Everyone around me told me he was mentally abusing me. I did not see it. But he would not let me have friends, he would get insanely jealous. I was not even allowed to go over to my female friends house, and when I did, he would get super angry. He controlled everything in my life. Got upset when I went to school and did not stay home to talk to him. Eventually he left me for one of my other friends online. I begged him to stay, I had never felt so broken. He did not. he would say awful things about me. The anxiety and depression got so bad I could not go to school. By this time, I was in grade 12. Every time I walked in the school, I had a panic attack. could not be around people. I tried online school, I could not do it. It was too difficult without a teacher. I still have not graduated. I have never had a job- its hard to leave my house. I cannot drive. I cannot cook. I cannot do anything by myself, my mother raised me to be super dependant. 3 years ago she started dating a guy (now fiance) she previously was best friends with. He was around me a lot when I was a child. I do not remember much. The meds make me forget most of my life including my school years. First couple years were fine. I eventually got really sick. Last year I developed severe ocd. Contamination ocd. I cannot touch anything he has touched. cannot have him in my apartment. My mother gets angry and blames me that she cannot be happy. I have tried 3 different meds since then, all the free therapists the government gives me. Nothing helps. They say I developed ocd as I most likely have psychological issues with men because of all the wrong they have caused me in my life. My family all acknowledges I need professional psychological help. They do not have the money for it. My mom is on permanent medical assistance as she has severe stage 4 endometriosis. My dad lives with his girlfriend who has kids, they cannot afford me or take me in either. My grandparents just want to live a chill retired life. They do not want me. My brother lives in a different province. This takes me to why I need to get out of here, though I have no place to go. Last night my mom got upset with me and said she wants her life back. she is sick of my mental illnesses and says she is going to have her fianc over. She acts like she forgets that I nearly starved to death last year, literally days away from starving, because I was too scared that what she cooked was contaminated because she was around him. The ambulance was called at my therapists office because he saw that I could barely stand up. I was shaking really bad. I was extremely malnourished. I was not able to shower for the same fear that she contaminated the shower. Again last year my mother called the police on me because I said I did not want to live anymore after she had threatened our relationship if he does not come over. She said that she would not watch movies with me anymore or be around or spend time with me at all (which really affected me because she was like my only friend. do not have barely any irl bc of my anxiety to leave the house and she knows this). Everyone I do talk to says that she emotionally abuses me so bad. I have a video of her saying that our relationship is nothing now anyways. This week she said she was going to lock me out of the fridge for getting a piece of balongne. She said that I have gluten on my hands (she has celiac) even though I did not even touch anything with gluten, and she said that I am probably the reason why she is been sick this past year. She wants to move in with her fianc, and I am the one holding her back. She always makes sure to let me know that I am the reason why she cannot have happiness in her life. She makes me feel like I am just a roadblock. And so much more. So when the police were called they came into our small apartment - 4 men. They forced the blood pressure machine on me even though I was crying telling them its contaminated. They told me to grow up and act like an adult. They told me that since they have been called twice now, that next time they are called they can put me in handcuffs and arrest me. It traumatized me so much. The self harm last year was out of control. Since that year I have gotten so much better by myself since my mother had been cooperating with me, giving me time to get better before she has her fianc over. I do not wear gloves inside my house anymore. I can eat. I can shower. I do not self harm. I have been socializing online a lot. However last night when she said she was going to start having him over I have fallen into some of the same habits. have not really been eating. Been super depressed. Been crying and shaking all day. I am scared it will be as bad as last year - probably way worse if he comes over. Hell contaminate everything just by being in here. I am so scared. I will not be able to leave my closed room. Ill be too afraid to eat or drink anything in fear of it being contaminated. I am so so scared. cannot stop shaking. Threw up after I tried to eat something. Last year I nearly died, I do not know what worse entitles. I am scared. I made so much progress. I do not want it all to be shattered. It will all be for nothing if she has him over. She will not let me get psychological help first either before she has him over. She says she cannot afford it and she is waited long enough. Shaking while typing this. Feel really sick. Stopped talking to my friends. Stopped doing anything except sitting in my room crying. She keeps threatening me that she will call the police again if I do not start eating. She says they will arrest me this time. But I feel so sick. I am so scared. No one can afford help for me. I cannot do anything. I am stuck. What do I do? I have psychological issues with men yet my mom is going to bring a man in the house. I am so scared. She does not care. I have tried reaching out to him personally and our family. No one cares. They all think I am being irrational. And that my mom deserves happiness too. They do not understand. No one does. And I am trapped. All I am is a roadblock. No one wants me. No one can take me. I am trapped in this home. It used to be the only place I feel safe, now its the scariest place. All I do is sleep because its the only time I am at peace. I cry every time I wake up because I realize I have to face this hell. I am trapped. I am scared. I have nowhere to go. What can I even do? I cannot drive to get out of here. I cannot do anything. cannot get a job to afford professional psychological help for myself. I am stuck. And its so so so scary. What can I even do? Throwaway - I need help, advice, anything. I am stuck.",Depression

"I should be happy, I have a supportive family and a decent job. But throughout my life I have struggled with severe anxiety and depression, and every decision, big or small, completely consumes me, sometimes for weeks. And because I overthink and lead with my emotions, I often make poor choices which leads to more anxiety and crippling regret. When I get good advice, I ""think"" myself out of it. I do not enjoy anything because my stomach is always in knots and my brain is on constant replay of what ""could have been"" had I done things differently. The only reason I carry on is because I have responsibilities to others and do not want to screw that up. I have tried talk therapy and some medication but the relief is temporary at best. I know this is wrong and completely non-productive, but I just cannot seem to break out of this self-destructive pattern. I make bad decisions and am consumed by regret",Depression

"Right I know this is going to sound like the biggest gurn ever but I really feel like I just need to get it off my chest.At the time of writing, I am 20 years of age. I have been in a relationship for 3 years now and we have been living together for one year. And I thought I was happy but I have looked back on my life recently and its filled with so many regretsWhen I was 18 my family and I got kicked out of our house because the person we were renting off decided to sell it, leaving us homeless. My mum and dad were able to stay at my sisters house and I was able to stay at my girlfriends. We thought we had it sorted in 3 weeks but it turned into 6 months before we got a house. The whole time I was working in a bar doing long, late shifts and I was not sleeping properly and constantly being sick because of it.We got a house sorted and three months later covid hit. I was put on furlough for three months before opening again. Just before I went back to work, myself and my girlfriend got our own place to live together. But things were not good whenever I went back to work She worked most mornings and I was always on the evening shifts so we never really got to see each other. I came home to her crying so many times and it was making me depressed because I felt so bad leaving her all the time . I then decided to find a new job to keep her happy and now I am in a job I do not like but i was able to finish at 5 so it made her happyA year has now passed and I feel like I am trapped. I feel like I have spent the last 3 years doing stuff to make her happy and not doing anything for my self and because of this I have seen so many opportunities pass me by because all I wanted to do was to make her happy because she took me into her home whenever I was homeless and I feel like I owe her so much for potentially keeping me alive. I do not want to see her upset but at the same time I am only 20.I feel like there is so much that I want to do before I get old. I do not want to waste my twenties in a relationship I am not sure I want to be in anymore but at the same time I am so scared to be alone because I do not think anyone else will ever want to be with me I wish I could just pack my bags and move to the other side of the world and start my life fresh and not tell anyone where I was going.I am sorry for such the long story I love yous all Trapped..",Depression

I took it as she had lost interest in me and I broke up with her. She could not seem to make time for me and I left for a trip and we had very little contact after I left. It seemed to me that she had no interest in having a conversation with me. She said that she thought I needed space, but idk why she would of thought that. She had became distant months ago and became more so as time passed. I am curious to know if this could be normal behavior of someone who is feeling overwhelmed and is moving through depression. All I wanted was to be there for her and to feel that she still cared. Once it felt like she did not care anymore, I could not do it any longer.

"Why am I just never good enough? I had a pretty depressing and neglected childhood. My brother was always the favorite kid and anything I accomplished never mattered. If my brother even got 70 percent, my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example, when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud, and when I was in 10th I got 93% and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you, it was just okay, why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school, and when I told my mother she just said okay, can you fucking believe it, just an OKAY. I just never feel enough, be it in my family, my friendships, or my relationship. Whatever I do, I can never be good enough. At this point, I do not even know if anyone cares about me for a second. I do not remember the last time I felt happy, all I remember is feeling sad, that is IT, THE ONLY EMOTION I FEEL. I hate feelings, I hate getting attached, I hate trusting someone, I have my mother, I hate it. I do not know if anyone will relate, but I always feel like I have lost myself. This just is not me.

Has anyone tried rexulti before? Question:,Depression
I was looking at some past friends social media and it made me realize even more how sad and pathetic my life really is. And yes before anyone says it I know social media is not real and only shows people the good sides and blah blah blah but still its clear these people are at least doing something in there life and trying to go after their dreams while I am just laying in bed..doing absolutely nothing for the past 4 years. Also I have no friends. I still really do not know why I have absolutely no friends like there are people who are absolutely shit and have tons of friends but I do not. At this point after this many years I have come to the conclusion I am just unlikeable for some reason. And I SWEAR to fucking GODDDD if someone tries to give me some advice on how to make friends. Trust me when I say I have done everything you possibly could to make friends. At this point I have given up and have decided to be friendless forever. Even if somehow someone all of a sudden wanted to be friends with me Id turn them down because Id be too pissed off that for some reason now that I do not give a shit about being alone now someone is trying to befriend me Id be mad.

I had cbt yesterday. My brother was angry because I did not want to talk about what feelings I discussed. He said he would not leave me alone until I answered. I do not want to talk about what feelings I discussed. He was saying how next time I should record the meeting and that they are pushing my mom out because she cannot sit in for the whole hour. My therapist said that I talk more in person when my moms not there and so he told me I should say less. I hate my life,Depression
"Work makes me feel like I am a slave trapped inside of a box. I have to put myself and soul into a prison cell for 8 hours while I apathetically get through the shift. How is this not suicidal? What part about that is fun? Its modern day feudalism at its finest. Jobs do not promote any individual growth. They just want you to willing to work 190 hours a week and do not give a fuck about mental health. They care zero. Instead you will be ostracized and scrutinized because you do not engage in the toxic one up culture every job has. It enslaves me and makes me feel uncomprehendingly trapped. There is a whole world out there and inside of me but I have to stand at this shithole for 8 hours? Id rather be dead. Who would not? Are you kidding me? The dread is unmatched. The dread is terrorizing and most people do not understand. They just tell me that is life. Some life we live. that is just such a joke to me. I have not even mentioned the miserable system. Its not just my job I hate. (I do hate it) but its working in general. The whole concept. People call me lazy but that is because they are brainwashed into believing selling your soul is the best way to live. Minimum wage jobs are so toxic. The management has zero regard for humanity, the employee morale is pathetically low, i do not give a fuck about the customers and they do not give a fuck about me. No one wants to be there. Then, you have to obtain experience to get a less shitty job and that whole process is miserable to. I wish I lived in a European or different culture where mental health and family relationships are more a priority then punching in hours on the clock. Sorry little brother, I cannot be there to support you for your game this Friday because I have to work and Ill be starving otherwise. Its so backwards. Fuck work Work makes me want to kill myself and no one understands",Depression

"I have been reaching out for help. I do EVERYTHING that I am told to help me feel better.Well today I called a place about the sexual abuse I went through as a kid. A charity that gives therapy to people who have gone through that.Well. Because I was not raped, it is not deemed bad enough. I was simply molested for 2 years by a neighbor as a kid so they do not think I can get help from them.I was referred to this place by a NHS mental health team who keep referring to these places. One place will tell me I am too severe to help. And now, this place says what happened was not bad enough. I was not even abused the right way. Even my abuse was done wrong.Which is the SECOND time I have heard it this week, about TWO different types of abuse. And then people have the cheek to ask me why I am so miserable. I am literally asking for help and doing all the rubbish I am told to do, and yet here we are.Damn. Just damn.(please no ""it gets better"". That makes me feel worse EVERY TIME) I was just told my abuse was not severe enough",Depression

"I feel vulnerable so often that I am starting to become fed up with living. I just want to be free from my constant anxiety and depression. Even as I write this, I want to drop dead leaving behind my fears of the world. I mean, we are all going to die anyway, what difference does it make if it happens now? As much as I admire the human race, I am also terrified of it. I find that the most dangerous people are often the most average. Having that mentality, it is hard to not feel threatened constantly. I cannot be around other people without having a whirlwind of negative emotions such as fear, sorrow, anger, etc. Perhaps I spend too much time on social media but just by observing people, I find that they can be incredibly cruel. You can see this for yourself, just look at the comments section of any youtube video and witness the discourse and anger that flows naturally through people. In my home town, there are large masses of homeless people, and it makes me sad seeing so many folks hit rock bottom. I have seen groups of teenagers beat down on said homeless people right in front of me. I have seen people do drugs, yell, fight, stab, rob. I have seen women do the most awful things to their children in public without any repercussions. I have overheard people spread hatred of other people. I have had family members die in horrible ways. I had old classmates who ended their own lives. I witnessed a man try to commit suicide on the highway. And I swear, I think (I do not know for sure, but I think) I saw one of my neighbors take a child prostitute into his home. I feel like I am surrounded by a society of cruelty and violence. But for some reason, I cannot help but love other people. However, this love does not dissuade me from wanting to leave this world. As childish as it sounds, I just wish that I could be born into a life where these issues are nonexistent. Despite being disturbed by appalling human behavior, I cannot help but fixate on it. It just feels like there are few positives in the world, and I just want to free myself from it. Living is terrifying",Depression

"I have had a rough life to start off with, I am only 18 years old, my birthday is in less than a month to turn 19. Today on the way home from the movies I was dropping my friend off and it was pouring, backing out I ran over a large rock the size of a large basketball, did not realize it at the time,so I drove home and smelled burning, got home and saw the rock still lodged underneath my car, destroying my radiator and other key components, I believe it is totaled. This would be the third car I have totaled in the past 3 years. My father is extremely stressed and I do not think he will ever let me drive a car again, I am stressed about college as well having little to no desire to continue due to lack of being able to focus. I have no money and recently the girl I was in love with left me and got a new guy, I still think about her every day but I know she does not and it kills me. I have nothing I want to live for anymore and I am seriously considering ending my own life. I cannot deal with this stress anymore and I want to be free but I feel like I am a financial burden to my family, I feel like I have no future and I feel like I will never find love again. So in my eyes I have nothing, I know it would hurt my family but it would save them a lot of money and stress in the long run. I do not have many real friends who I can talk to, and I do not have any close family members who will listen so its like I am trapped in this by myself. I cannot take any of this anymore and I think I really am going to do this. I cannot take it anymore and I need help I am driving myself isane I think its my time",Depression
"I am still very depressed, but it is hard to recount my deep lows. Got to a point where I would lay in bed and eat my weight. Eventually, there was no differentiation between tasks like eating, jogging, watching T.V. It became laying in bed, and the anything else is ""not laying in bed.""did not care when I was dressed or had shoes when I drove around, I just did the goal, paid the bill. It was pure apathy, I did not care where or who I was, as long as I was not dying, it was O.K.Nothing had made me upset after getting to this point. I did not care that my hair looked awful after killing it, I did not care looking bad. It was comfortable to feel nothing, no worries, so I would not ever bother to leave.But at the end of the year, I looked in the mirror. 60 L.B.s overweight, no friends, no hobbies, no aspirations. Nothing. I did not recognize myself. The entire year felt like one long day of laying in bed.

"I have been depressed since I was 10. I am 29 now. I do not remember feeling happy ever. I have felt joy for short periods, but for as long as I remember I have just wished I did not exist. For years I have dreamed and toyed with the idea of ending it, but it has never been an option because it would hurt my family. But now thinking rationally why am I supposed to suffer with this faulty mind? If I feel I would be better of gone then why would not the people that care about me be happy that I was able to set my self free from my mind?When I was younger I still had something to wait for which maybe got me going on minimal effort. ""I will just see if finishing school improves things just a little."", ""Maybe I will be happier when I get my drivers license because I have wanted to drive for years"". Well after ""achieving"" these things I always returned back to suffering quickly.I now have everything I have ever dreamed for and more. I had friends. I have a caring family.. I have all material things I want and need. I accidentally had a relationship that ended a month ago. I had given up on women long ago because I was sure I would just bring pain to someone that got close to me. A really good girl just happened to fall for me and I went with the flow. Not surprisingly it ended quickly and the girl got hurt. I spiraled lower than ever and maybe it is time for me to be objective and understand that I am not fit for life or this society.there is just no purpose in my life. There never has been and objectively why would there ever be. I do make profit for the company I work for and the government does get some tax out of me. Am I obligated to keep on living because of this? I do not think so. Maybe it would be time to finally be rational, see the bigger picture and just end things.",Depression

Okay. So I just posted a post in the blind community As I am blind myself. And I got called racist and entitled I am neither of those things. It was something that happened to me when someone tried to guide me using a newspaper. Now why I ask do I care what a stranger thinks? I know I should not But it is really discouraged me. I had to get that out as its been stewing on my mind for the last three years since it happened And that is what I get for it. Am I overreacting? Or is it the depression talking? And then you get people saying you need to stop worrying A lot easier said than done when you have got depression. I have been a member of this forum for just over 24 hours And already thinking of leaving. I do not want to as I really like it and I have met a lot of nice people But that really got to me.Considering I work in a job which tackles racism.

I woke up today and after feeling slightly better for maybe six months I got a letter in the mail my insurance company is reevaluating my claim for long-term disability. I feel like I just went through their evaluation by other MDs a year ago and now they sent a whole package of information for me and my doctor to complete. I am so tired of life I need to be out of work. I lost my job because of mental and physical health and there is nothing to go back to. How can they do this evaluation again? What if my doctors do not say the correct things on the forms. I am shaking with fear because the only way I am surviving is on disability and I was ready to end my life before they took me out of work. I just cannot do it. I am so tired and afraid.

"I am really depressed, I had some kind of massive childhood trauma trigger a while ago when a similar feeling situation happened, only realised what it was recently. I have two partners (we are poly, it is chill).

That is not something I want, so I need distance.I have to work through the whole spectrum of child abuse and I do not feel safe talking to anyone now that I know I drain them.

"I find myself between a hard place and a rock, I am a 30M and my wife is 26F. We have a blended family and that on its own is sometimes a challenge with all the different schedules. I am reaching out because I am finding it hard to manage my time with all 4 kids, supporting my wife, work and home responsibilities and upkeep. I work from home so that has definitely made things a bit easier, during work hours I use my work breaks and lunch times to tend to the kids or check in on my wife.

How do I tell my wife I need quality time and space with the kids without sending her down a hole of emotions, anxiety &amp; overthinking?

"Like really, are you going to tell someone who is depressed to ""stop with the siege mentality and move on with life""? Sure, you may be depressed also with the current sh\*t show of how the upper echelons are handling this pandemic and the never-ending lockdown that takes a toll on people's mental health, but telling others with your hard love will not help anybody.Plus, stop telling me to seek professional help. Your intention may be helpful, but I am done with the ""so-called"" mental health professionals or therapists who were being unempathetic. I hate spending my hard-earned cash on seeking professional help, only to get my mental health worse (been caught by this once), and being in a country where religion is omnipresent, are you going to see a professional advising you on religious stuff instead of supposedly helping you personally? I have been super duper wary with seeing another professional after my first experience seeing an unempathetic one ever since.Also, if you are in the good, you do not need to brag that what you did was working for you. Sure, yeah, good for you that it works, but stop expecting others to be on the same page as you too, no matter how good the intention is. Again, be empathetic. If that person does not want to do what you did, just do not force him or her further with your intentions, can you?By the very least, can people be more empathetic? everyone is dealing hard with the current situation right now, but if you are in the good (or even not so good), you do not need to be an a\*\*. Being empathetic really means a lot for many, including myself. Even a simple video call that cheers up each other would mean a lot, I have to admit.I am sorry if my words are all over the place.

"I feel sad and alone with nobody that really cares about me. Every day I think about ending my life and I tell myself that it is only a matter of time. People say there is always hope and all you need is something to hold onto. There is very little in my life that is worth holding onto. It seems like every opportunity in my life I have lost or for whatever reason it has been taken away from me. My health is not great, and it is not getting better, it is going to do me in eventually. I do not do drugs except the ones I am prescribed, and I do not drink.A lot of the time, I feel trapped inside myself and inside a life I do not want. I have stopped leaving home, not unless I have to, and I just want to get back home as soon as I can. I do not feel comfortable being around people any more.I unfriended just about everybody who is not family on Facebook, and I closed my account a day or so ago. It sucks that I have so little to share with anyone and nothing in common. Mostly, I just share music videos and random stuff that no one is interested in.There is no one close to me except my elderly mother who I live with. She cares about me, and she is probably my only reason for hanging on. it is going to be hard managing without her because I really depend on her. I feel pathetic admitting it.It feels good to share, maybe I am looking for attention, I tired of this stuff weighing me down all the time. There is so much more to my story, and maybe I will share it, I do not know. I saw an AA meeting on TV, the support group and the whole sponsor thing, and I wondered why there is not something like that for someone like me. I do not like therapy, I am done with it. It does not work, especially when you know that there is a cut-off point to the sessions. Lack of funding. It feels like they do not give a dam until you try to hurt yourself or someone else. Not until you become a problem, and they are forced to deal with you.At least if I can share stuff here with you guys and get stuff out of my system. Maybe, it will make me feel a bit better.

That accepting that I have this problem is just nurturing the sickness so I cannot even talk to her about this.The only friend I have is depressed too so I would not want to burden him.

"I feel really lost I’m 17 years old and I feel so lost, confused and like a major failure. A little backstory… I graduated Highschool at age 15, took an 8 month break before starting with university and when I started I had to move to new country and manage everything by myself at 16, I started slacking ever since I had arrived tbh I barely did my work cause I had no clue where to start or what to do but whenever I had an understanding of the work and what to do, Id get really proud of my outcome but moving on from that i was barely attending my lectures and doing anything by the end of the year so I had failed my first year, I wasn’t very proud of myself however I did it to myself so I had to accept and move on from it and figure out how to do better, I’m now 17 repeating my first year and classes have in the beginning of this month and I feel like it’s almost the same thing as last year. I’ll be turning 18 in a few months and I feel like a shit human and I actually am trying but I just don’t know what to do with myself… if you’ve ever felt like this and had gotten thru it please give me advices",Depression

"I have been doing a lot lately to fight the depression I have been battling for years and recently I took a long vacation where the entire purpose was to work on my mental health. I started eating healthier, cut back on my drinking I even got outside in nature more and holy shit some craziness started happening. The air felt more airy, the grass looked greener and the birds chirping hit me as a beautiful song and not an annoying sound interrupting my thoughts.I did not stop the good habits but I woke up recently and everything was dull again the same scenery that brought tears to my eyes a few days before looked muted and weak. The fear and the anxiety I had been trying to knock out came back but this time stronger. Now this is normally where I quit fighting. I do not want to quit just those few days of seeing the world with refreshed eyes was a high I could not even describe I do not want to give up on that. But like I said it feels even more intense this time, so I probably have to level up my efforts. For those of you who have been battling and seen major improvements only to get sucker punched when you were least expecting it. How do you get back up and back in the fight? I have been fighting depression and kicking some tail. But its fighting back. Tips for when the monster comes roaring back?",Depression

I will never get a job or go to live on my own because my parents are scared to leave me. Why? Because I am mentally ill. I got what I wanted. I got a therapist, a psych, a diagnosis... Depression is ruining my fucking life and I hate it so much. Sometimes I wonder if I will die and rot alone because nobody cares. My parents will die eventually and my friends? it is not like they give any fucks about me anyway. No one's been THAT kind to me ever. But I do not blame them. They have their own lives and I am not part of their life. I am not their first priority. I will never be someone is first priority because I do not seek what ""normal"" people want. I do not understand why having a partner is a requirement. I do not want love I just want friends. But everyone is a two-faced piece of shit. Sorry...I really needed to get this out of my chest.

"Okay, I do not know where to start and it is going to be pretty unorganised. And I cannot completely express myself, so most of it is going to end up in my mind again ig, I not sure.I am introvert, antisocial, athiest , logical etc and this personality was not expected by my parents and people around me. they always have been forcing me to change my personality. I want to explain them so hard and with that rage , you know , so that they feel it ig , that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday , shouting and wasting your time , just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that , people here , all neighbours , judge a lot, and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted, and I have to pretend , which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you , I do not want to talk to you, but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep, I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made , how stupidly wrong they were , it is not like I am correct, but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words , it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain, is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight. So most of the times I am like , I cannot do anything now , I do not care , I will just move on, but at night I realise how it is going to affect my life and I am like why did not I do that, why did not I say that and get depressed everytime. I am sure that I am going to struggle my entire life and end up destroying opportunities and just imagine how my life would have been better. I am lonely , never been in a relationship and have few online friends which is another source of depression and there are more things . Sorry if I have been just repeating topics also it was not as interesting and thank you if you read all of this . Idk why am I sharing this , idc about upvotes, It is just like when I am explaining about how wrong people were about the concepts , to myself, which does makes me somewhat happy ig ,but I end up in depression again , bc that is not going to happen.

"I am working myself to death, purposely. Autistic with ADHD. 37, No family of my own or relationships, moved back with aging parents because isolation became too much to the point I started planning my suicide.

I have nothing in my life but work, my job pays the bills. And after I finish my 9-5, I work on a couple of projects that are both artificially keeping me alive because they give me some goal or purpose but at the same time are killing me because between my job and this I spend around 14 hours a day frying my brain in front of a computer.

I used to be in shape, but I have relinquished that part of me as well since it serves no purpose anymore. I gave up on relationships, dating and love, and it is a waste of time and effort since I invest that energy on my projects or resting, and well my best years are behind me and entropy is doing its thing anyway.

I tried searching for when we will be immortal and no answers came up. I am trying so hard to not die, but at times I tell myself that I should lay down AND die. I have tried to focus on other things, I tried watching meme comps on youtube. I tried listening to music and going outside. I wanted to get caught up on life residuals, I wanted to see the beauty of nature to heal and cope. But it is chaotic, at least humanity is. You do not see other animals doing what we do. So many of us have different experiences and memories. There are things I want to experience for myself. but will not be able to within whatever time I have left. The worst part is I think my life span has decreased, I inhale at least 32mg of weed (I do not smoke but I hang with people who do smoke). I am fat, I weigh in at 197 pounds, I have no real friends and that is shown to decrease lifespans.

Well guess what, I DO feel terrible for existing in the first place!I cannot even fight them. I used to try and beat up anyone that bullied me in school, but I would either lose or beat them so hard out of senseless anger that I get suspended or threatened with expulsion, while the bully gets no punishment. That would eventually lead to the first suicide attempt and hospitalization. I have been hospitalized eight times for suicidal/homicidal ideation and attempts, and I have gone to prison before for one of those times. Point is, I deserve the worst death possible. that is why I was about to swallow this entire bottle of Hydroxyzine Pamoate, at ~275 capsules of 25mg each, that should at least give me the pain I deserve, if not kill me. Since I have to prove to those arrogant humans who want me to die that I am the most selfish and idiotic person ever, I am thinking I should go to the 7/11 around the corner, when that one cashier who told me to go f myself the other day is working, and buy some water from him and use it to drink down the entire pill bottle in front of him, since everyone hates me so much they would all literally enjoy it and cheer. Ill even carve a suicide note out of my blood saying I REGRET NOTHING and give it to him as a tip.I am making this thread out of the small sliver of hope for life I still have, but it seems I have already tried everything.

I cannot paddle around and hold out a rope for you to cling to, when I am not sure, you even want to grab it.I started to dissociate like I always do, when I cannot handle the pressure.

I am tired of trying to stay afloat. I am tired of trying. I just want to go down, drown and let it the fuck go. I do not know, where these words came from. I heard them, like someone else was talking. But the longer I think about it, the more I think its True. I am totally lost at the moment. Should I keep going there, but than I need goals?

"I have often passively ideated it, but I feel like I am sinking more &amp; more into active ideation where now I really do wonder if my story will end with me dying by my own hand. A huge part of me really really wants it all to be over because I am so tired of living in the US &amp; being part of the system, but another part really does want the story to get better. Like maybe I *can* leave the country &amp; end up doing something I love.I do not know if that is likely though. I think its super likely Id just end up sad &amp; alone. I do not really have family. &amp; all my friends have their own lives with lots of families &amp; other friends. &amp; I am so far out of the norm because I am not cis &amp; I am neurodivergent &amp; I do not even know much about falling in love because romance is a huge scary mystery to me that I just do not understand or really experience like normal ppl do. I like film studies though. &amp; I love helping people. &amp; I have had an excellent academic career so far (finished undergrad). Id really love to be a professor someday &amp; help students the way my professors have helped me. Id like to help make education more inclusive &amp; accessible. But its getting harder to be a professor these days. Grad school could be a lot more affordable in other countries, but I am not sure yet if there is even a film studies program out there for me that is still affordable. It might be a little bit too niche. A lot of the world is not friendly for nonbinary people. Its getting easier in some places, but its still hard. It makes me wonder if there is a place for me in this world when everything is the way that it is. I have friends who care about me, but even when I did reach out for help, so few answered. Only one sounded really genuine. I think everyone is tired of me. &amp; that hurts too. I do not think Ill be ending things quite so soon, but its always on my mind. I keep asking myself whether living is really worth it &amp; when, if not, will I finally initiate the final act? *Sigh.* I hate not knowing. I keep weighing the possible rewards of keeping my subscription to living against the relief of no longer having to pay for it. Even then, I still feel like I am in a trial period except I do not know when its going to end. When should I have a decision? I wish I knew! I wish it was easier.

But if you ask me if I wanted to be born, Id say yes. For sure I would. But never in a poor family like my case. Id choose to be born in a wealthy family with two real parents and not two poor narcissistic parents like mine. 2nd: Human Rights assure me many things I never had.

I already have a $500+ backlog of payments to make to my current therapist, who is been graciously patient while I get my finances in order.I told her all this, and she was like in this flat tone ""okay, what is your plan C?"" as if it was just the easiest thing I could come up with on the spot. And I was just, stunned in silence for a moment, and then just hung up.This just feeds as another sign that this world is horrible and life is not worth living. I look desperately for help, and cannot find any. The top result for google searches of ""depression hotline"" or ""mental health crisis hotline"" is all ads for things that look like scams.

But since I do not have anybody else to talk to I might aswel vent here before I decide to off myself. &amp;#x200B;So today I lost my job. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming from miles away but on the other hand, I wish it did not happen or atleast I would wish to be able to turn back time to prevent some things from happening. But we do not have such a thing, so my life is fucked either way.So, the first week of 2020 I gave up a deadbeat, no life job for something promising, something with a future. Raised out of a family where such a thing is an impossibility, I could have atleast try. Everything was fine, I loved the job, It was physical, it was a challenge, I felt... Happy. 3 months later, I find myself in hospital. I broke my ankle at my job. Again, in hindsight, my fucking mistake. I twisted my ankle at a location where it happened once shortly before, but a donkey does not hit the same rock twice in a row right? Right. I spend 2 months in a cast, longer than what was expected and another month out of the cast before I could even attempt going to work. That should have raised an alarm bell. I wanted to go back to work, so I went earlier than what was recommended. And such, I went to work; They gave me adjusted work, essentially I had to sit in an office like space, controling valves, pumps and monitors. But no matter what I did, how patient my boss was the pain endured. And weeks of adjusted work became months, months turned into a year. The pain stayed the same to the cost of several different treatments. Every step I take on that foot is the same as getting stabbed. Even when I did not stand on it for 4 hours, 10 minutes of walking made the pain come back, 50x worse than it was before. And as my inactivity began to extend, so did my weight. And in the meantime, gossip &amp; bullying started to become a regular occurence. To the point where the bullies claimed I did not deserve a lunch break, or that I am doing nothing but sit on my ass an entire day... I had multiple talks about it, every time the promise of betterment was made. But every time, the bullying became worse. My mental state began to decline. Up to the point where I left half an hour earlier because I could not take the abuse no more and told my boss how I felt. And so, I was brought up for a final conversation. I could not even defend myself this time. ""it is time to let you go"", and was ordered to give everything back, from keys to badge... &amp;#x200B;This job was all I had. it was my jumpstart to a better life, a one time opportunity that was wasted because of a fucking accident that dominated my entire career. And it is all my fault. If I was not fat, my ankle could heal properly. If I did not show anger and frustration all the time, I could have kept my job.If I was not honest about how I felt, I could have kept my job. At home, I have nothing, nobody. Because of Corona, all my friendships watered down to the point where they did not reply back. Work was all I had. And now I do not have anything. Nobody to talk to, nobody to vent to. Alone, at the age of 26. Sad fuck. For years I have felt miserable but it was do-able, manageable even. But now I feel worse than that. A sorrow that drowns me out with no sign of ever getting better, not to mention the physical pain I have at the moment. I cannot take it no more... If I was not this ugly blob of meat I could have had somebody to support me right now. I am going to OD myself on both pain, antidepressants and alchohol later this week and pray it works. I am just going to make some arrangements until then. &amp;#x200B;I just wanted to share my story for the record. Even though it is vague and incomplete. Alright, so... I lost my job today and now I got nothing left.",Suicidal
"I am in crisis.When I go into crisis my mind screams for me to kill myself. In my chest and stomach and heart radiatiating out in all directions is pain, and the pain screams for me to kill myself.Why does my body want me to kill myself?

I was thinking about telling him until at dinner the other night he said depression does not exist so I am not telling him. My mom is nicer than my dad. I told her I was depressed like a month ago and she cried. Then I asked her if she would take me to the doctor to get diagnosed and she said ok. But that was a month ago and she still never made an appointment. I am a lazy fuck who sits at home all day with no friends and I am not going to keep living this way. I have to end it. I need to.

I am not helping anyone by being around either. there is something wrong with me and I cannot just sit this out. it is a feeling that comes in waves but this one has not gone away. it is been 2 months now since the feeling has started and the feeling itself is one that tells me over and over that ""I do not belong here,I do not deserve to be here"".I am going to sleep on this but I genuinely think I need help regardless of any label others may put to me.

"for the longest time suicide was like a second option for me. just having the choice to get rid of everything without having to worry about the future was comforting by itself. growing up, anytime anything would go wrong, id comfort myself that i would merely wake up from this nightmare if i mustered up the courage to kill myself. it was almost like someone would be whispering on my ear that things will be okay and to never take things seriously because there is a permanent off button. this mentality has stayed with me for years and now I am approaching adulthood. i will soon turn 18 years old. due to this mentality, I have been academically slacking off and avoiding the topic of what do you want to do when you grow up. i told myself that i would never live to see the day i graduate and that its impossible that id ever become an adult. 10 year old promised me that i would kill myself before turning 18. my birthday is just a month away and I am scared. my younger self has gone through so much. my parents were always ones to never fulfill their promises and i do not wish to become like them. i want to at least do this for my 10 year old self, whether i want to or not. my life has definitely not gotten any better. sure, there were moments where id experience bursts of happiness and id actually feel glad to be alive but the down moments have been getting more frequent. i blamed my suicidal thoughts on this specific factor in my life which i got rid of a few months ago. things were actually getting better. i was actually talking to my dad more frequently and i was havign so much fun just talking to my younger brother. grades were looking fine and everything seemed to be going ridiculously well. my luck ran out just a month after and things were back to normal. my version of normal at this point is just sitting in my room all day without doing anything productive and having minimal contact with my family members. my suicidal thoughts soon continued and would frequently visit me every few hours. the reminder from my dad that id be kicked out once i turn 18 did not help either. when i was 13, i was actually attempting suicide for the first time. initially i wanted to run away from home but seeing how unrealistic it was, i wondered if id die if i were to jump off the second floor of my house. logically speaking i would not have died but maybe i would have gotten medical help to cure these thoughts. i wish i could have reached out for help earlier in my life. i mean, i do not think anybody would have done anything since they cannot exactly understand me. my dad was struggling so much as a single parent and I am sure he was suicidal himself. i heard from somewhere that these thoughts are hereditary so i would not be surprised if he suffers from them as well. i wish i could go back in time and talk to my younger self. today i got involved in a discussion which ended up with my dad and i practically talking about our past. once upon a time i was close with my dad and id actually talk to him everyday. with the flow of time we ended up talking less and less due to multiple conflicts. our relationship is now irreparable. i cannot get myself to hug him properly or tell him how much i love him because that is just so foreign to me. i feel so sorry for everyone including my past self. i did nothing but burden everyone with my issues. i wonder why i was born. i wonder what is the point of this life. I am in so much pain i do not know what to do. even now i have the choice to end it all but i do not think my dad deserves this. maybe I am just making excuses for myself. if i die, who will take care of my cat anyway? i wish i could restart this life. just venting, not in need of any kind of help",Suicidal

"CW: religion/spirits, bad thoughts So I have been having a rough time lately. Feeling like ending it all. Like, all the time. Its so miserable. I constantly have migraines and stomach aches just from the sheer depression and anxiety. So I always try to tell myself different reasons why I should not. One of my major reasons &amp; thoughts lately have been if my spirit would stay stuck feeling that way forever? do not know anyone elses religious beliefs but raised a Christian ofcourse were taught we will not go to heaven if we end our own lives. And I have had such bad days with terrible migraines and body aches and depression and it makes me want to put a bullet in my head. But then I think, if I kill myself now, will I suffer from migraines and depression for the rest of eternity? (Provided the religious beliefs are indeed true).

I am literally just existing for other peoples sake and I do not even feel they benefit from that either other then feeling good about themselves when they feel like they did the right thing by talking me out of it people do not understand the urge that has taken over my core the only thing that is stopping me is pain. And I am just trying to figure out how to get past that point. I lost my love. He did what I plan to. I just cannot see myself without him in this life. I just want to be in his space and I want to do what he did to me to everyone else I have ever cared about because I am so bitter and heartbroken. With guilt and with regret I cannot live like this anymore. All I wanted was to be a good mother. To be loved and understood. Left in the cold again. And again. This is such a complicated story to explain with many details missing. Just know that I do not think suicide is selfish. And I have felt like this since before I lost my love. I can never forgive myself for letting go of the one who truly loved me. I can not stand another second of this reality.

I essentially either die a painless death while I have the opportunity to, or I watch my life fall apart slowly over the next 4 months as everyone is disappointed in me, I lose my job, I get evicted from my condo, my credit score crashes, and my mental health deteriorates while all of this goes on. Then I am living in a tent in the woods until I starve or freeze to death. I have autism and ADD and I cannot handle living alone in a city I am unfamiliar with. My parents kicked me out over my autistic outbusts and had me buy a place and will not let me back in. I do not know what to do. Do I live as though I only have a few months left to live and watch as my life falls apart? Or do I run before I see everything fall apart and leave in a half-decent mental state? Some people say to hold onto the chance that my parents will show pity and let me back in if I am homeless. Part of me thinks that is not happening and so I think I would rather end my life painlessly while I have the chance to. And yes, I have done extensive research and it is very easy to have a painless death. There is something you can buy for about $100 where all you do is release it in an enclosed space and within 1 minute you pass out, within 5 minutes you die a painless death.

"(I have already made a post in the past, but accidently deleted it) So I am a 15 year old, about to break up from school for the summer, so I should be happy, right? Wrong. My entire life, I have felt like the world just hates me. My dad died of a cocaine overdose, when I was 4. My mums alcohol dependent. My family struggles to afford food and rent. I am worried to be outside with my 13 year old sister, because I do not want to look like a pedo. The reason why I think this, is because I am mixed-race (my dad was white British, and my mums black Jamaican), and me and my sister look very different from each other (I am quite pale and white, but my sisters black), and I often get people staring at us, when were out in public. I also have the very disturbing worry, that in the future, my sister might get sexually assaulted/raped. I get bullied at school, for being an awkward mess, and people go out of their way, to make me look even more stupid than I already do. I self harm myself, by getting any sharp object I can get hold of, and lightly cut my arm. I do not want to kill myself, I just do not want to exist. Thank you for your time Pls help",Suicidal

TLDR: Found explicit photos and vids of partners ex on family iPad, he says masturbating is different to having sex and he is sorry and will delete them, AIBU to forgive him? Today I went on the family iPad to find the presentation my partner created for his dads funeral a few years back. I wanted it because it has lots of photos of him as a child so wanted to create an album with our son for his birthday next month. So I go into the folder and there in 'recents' there are tons of naked photos of his ex from 2017. At first I just broke down as thought they had been sent recently but then when I looked at the info on the files it stated they were created in 2016 and 2017 so seems like they are just old explicit photos and explicit videos of her he has kept. I looked what folder they were in and they were saved to a folder that looks like an old work file folder - but all that is in the folder is explicit photos and videos of her. Looking at different ones I can see that they have been viewed throughout 2019 (when I was pregnant) and thoughout 2020/21 and up to as recently as the weekend. I confront him about it and at first he tried making out is is not a big deal. Eventually after explaining how I feel he has agreed it was wrong and has apologised but accused me of overreacting. For more info I had a traumatic birth and it has left me with nerve damage and a lot of scars all over my abdomen due to further surgeries. I suffered with PND but went to therapy and was put on meds and I am doing so well now. Started my own business and pay for sons childcare 2 days a week and looked after him the rest of the time. Despite this I ask for sex a couple time a week but he only says yes about one every 5/6 weeks. I asked Fri, Sat and Sun this weekend, he said no on all occasions but can see that fri and Sun evening he viewed these photos so clearly decided to have a wank over her than have sex with me. I have never had issues with him viewing porn. He says that he views these photos the same way as porn but I do not, he has slept with this woman many, many times before we got back together (they were together for just four months when we were on a break instigated by me not him) He has agreed to delete them and says he understand why I am upset and he will not ever do anything like it again.

I can now explain why on a chemical and biological level, I feel the way I do, and it only makes things worse nowadays. I have tried to take on a hedonistic mindset to circumvent the already dark thoughts with the peace that well its all essentially pointless.. but I am not a hedonist, and as much as I say I *do not* care I really do care at the umpteenth power. Its fucking hard. Especially when you have no one to go to. When you do not feel comfortable enough to speak about your thoughts because the people who are supposedly there for you, cannot be bothered- and its not their fault. We have all these words and concepts to wrap things up in a neat little bow and capartamentalize things until they are in boxes so small we act like we forget they are there. Its sickening and I feel like I am going to vomit, but I am not a puker so I know I will not. I am sitting here in a stew of my own self-loathing and I do not want to be here anymore. cannot say I did not try.",Suicidal

Now she is just carrying on with her day like nothing happened, unlike the other times where she would drive me around the city to hopefully cheer me up. Just ignoring me now. Tbh I deserve it.I know I am a fucking asshole and a shit daughter.I know I cannot count on others to pick me up when I break down like this, especially when I am the piece of shit in this scenario but I cannot help myself. Right now I feel like she is tired of my dramatic shit, hence she is ignoring me, letting me do whatever I want. she is just waiting for me to get my shit together to so I can stand on my own and actually get shit done. But I refuse to. I do not want to try anymore. I am fucking tired, so fucking tired of acting like I am strong, motivating myself all over again so I can end up exactly like this again and again and again. I do not want a better life for myself. she is better off without me, she has more loyal friends than I will ever have.

"Anything positive will do! I am very tempted to just give up. Ironically the trigger was posting on Reddit; but I have nowhere else. I have all I need to die. I was planning on it but I managed to get myself out of it, but again I have ended up back here. Probably my own fault, though was not helped by how negative most spaces online are. I want to die because there is no point. I have wanted to die for years, I have attempted plenty of times. I finally found a reason to live recently in that I am trans. That realisation gave me hope, but that is long faded. Its years on waiting lists, its the stress of fighting my corner all the time. Constant abuse online. No one in my life understands. I wake up and I see a man. An ugly pathetic man. It does not feel like me, and I have to go through the day colleagues, and strangers seeing me as a man. Dead naming me. All because nobody understands. The constant hate in the media, on social media, even at my university! Then I think is it even worth it? What if I do not pass, what if being a women is not enough? what is the gain from continuing to live? The only reason I am reaching out is i made the mistake of convincing myself I could cope. I wish Id never done that, wish Id given up long ago. I have written this in a rush at work, sorry if it makes no sense. I am used to people ignoring me.I know I am not worth the time. I have been told I am selfish and attention seeking. So that is probably all this is. Need help! Plan to die tonight.",Suicidal
"I am 23 now. Since I am 14/15 years old I have constantly been in Therapy or Hospitals.However, when certain parts of my Life come up, I either avoid them or straight up lie to my therapist, mostly out of shame. But over time there are so many Symptoms crawling up that I often have the feeling that they probably thing I am overreacting. In terms of medication nothing really ever helps, they often tried to beat whatever just came up with neuroleptics or antidepressants and they only thing that ever helped was putting myself to sleep with benzos, which is not something my Psychiatrist is willing to give me that often. I recently dared opening up about a completely unrelated Topic, which now makes everyone think, that maybe that is the reason for everything that is been wrong all my life, and while I am happy that i can now talk about that, It almost feels like it makes everything else worse.I am sorry If I do not go into enough details but I am very paranoid about opening up to much.Essentially I would be incredible thankful for any advice how to overcome shame and for once just be 100% honest to my therapist, because honestly going on like this is not an Option and I am not going to fail again.

"Not necessarily in this community, although I have seen it here before, but just in general. Someone will post in or speak about how they overcame their suicidal urges and their depression in groups of people who are all depressed and suicidal; take all the congratulations and ""I am proud of you""'s but never explain how the achieved it or give advice or even RESPOND to people asking them how they did it.Now I know nobody is entitled to anyones story, but when you dangle it in front of people who could reall use its faces, it just feels so cruel yknow? Like someone from a poor neighborhood returning to their home rich and successful and they never tell their old friends and fanily or even just people in the neighborhood who NEED it how they did it. They just stand around in the neighborhood to be admired and praised and when someone asks them how they got to that point they either ignore them or give them that same half assed vauge ""it gets better"" answer. Its good that you overcame your illness. Its good that you decided to not kill yourself or your attempt failed and you decided to live and work on getting better. Congratulations. But PLEASE if you are going to share give us SOMETHING to look forward to. Even if its specific just give us ANYTHING. do not gloat to people in your old situation about how much better you are doing and keep the methods you used a secret. Meds? Love? Therapy? Religion? A fucking hobby??? Give us something to use.One of the few things that pushes me closer to ending it is being so *close* to getting advice, real advice from someone who actually understands, on how I can save myself; and then having that information withheld. And again, I am not entitled to anyones story and nobody is obligated to tell strangers on the internet about their very personal battle; but shit if you are going to brag about how you became happy to a bunch of depressed people at least tell us how.

"Being up north in a cabin in the woods, snow and pines all around. Alone, trees and mountains all around. Alone.

Pulling a handgun out from the drawer in the corner. Placing it in my mouth, or on the side of my head? on my temple? whichever way it is with full intentions to pull the trigger. Am I really meant to stay alive? Was told to stay alive, but for what? Only to create more misery? The ones who have said it disappeared in the wind. To stay alive to not exist? To live only to wish to end this misery, wishing to end this thing called living? We all meet the earth in our deteriorating bones eventually. I have no legacy. I will be forgotten like the ones before me. I think these things as I am pressing the ball of the barrel to my temple. I think of him, who first said to me to stay alive even though he disappeared and said to never call back. Why am I still here? I want to cry, to scream to take this pain away. Am I really going to give in to living or just end it all? TAKE THIS PAIN AWAY! End MY MISERY! I lower the gun and fold into a ball. The gun lay at my head, the gun laying in full sight. I stare at it, conscious of the outside, the wind shifting frame of this cabin. I close my eyes and pray I no longer want to be alive. To fall asleep. To wake up alive. I want to die!

"Its been exactly one year. 11th July 2020. I tried, failed and ended up snapping some ligaments from landing on my ankle unconscious.

Why the FUCK did I not hide all the scissors and knives? that is how it got interrupted. My mother cut me down from the perfect hanging set up I had. Just a few more minutes and I would be AT PEACE.

I do not want to hear maybe its water weight, or your diet is wrong. because its been working for 3 months and now all of a sudden I am gaining weight. Its upsetting. I have atypical anorexia so this was a deviating blow for me. I am still in my bathroom on the ground crying my eyes out, coming down from a panic attack.

However, the destructive nature of self hate is trivialized and marginalized by doctors, therapists and professors. Euphemisms and oversimplifications are what we are taught to combat self hate and its honestly pretty hopeless. We are told to just think a positive thought we are told to realize negative thoughts are irrational. They pretend to be is groundbreaking philosophers. Telling us things like your thoughts create your reality and you have to control your thoughts The buffet of bullshit is endless. We are then proceeded to be labeled as self loathers and they tell us you do not want to get better just because we cynical towards this bullshit advice. I am over it. Its just so obvious to me that they cannot accept there are other factors other than my conscious thoughts that make me miserable. They do not want to hear it though.

"I did not really know what to title this. Turns out, I had another note in my phone. I deleted that though, so this is the only one you have to read. I really hope that nobody resents me after I do this, but that is out of my control. Even right before I die, I cannot stand the thought of people hating me. The thought literally makes me sick. I would say I am not really feeling anything at the moment, but that would be a partial lie. On the inside, I have no emotional reaction that I can feel (which I usually can). But, a song that means a lot to me just came on, and I started to cry. Its called Might you, and its in my Spotify likes, aguyss well as my Anime playlist. Can you play this song at my funeral? Its from My Hero Academia, so not many people there (if anyone shows up) will understand the context, but its a good song even without knowing the series. Its 11:09 pm right now. I do not know how long this note will take me. I guess I should say sorry to everyone, but there are surprisingly few people that I talk to. Really, its only my family and people at work. that is kind of sad. Mom and dad, I am sorry that I could not be the daughter you dreamed I was going to be. Frankly, I am not your daughter at all, since I am (was?) non-binary (neither a man nor a woman). Please do not refer to me as your daughter at my funeral. I do not care if that will confuse any relatives. I love you guys. ******, I am sorry I was such a jerk. I am really sorry that I would pick on you, and fight with you, and overall annoy you every single day. To make up for it, you can have all of my stuffed animals, as well as all of my snowglobes. I love you. ******, I am sorry I did not work harder to be closer to you. I am sorry I was a little asshole when we were growing up (which is why you hated me probably up until you went to Italy for that period of time). You were a great older sibling, and I wanted to be just like you for a long time. you are the reason I got into art, even though I have not really drawn anything in forever. do not be afraid to be yourself, even when it seems like everything will go wrong if you do. I love you. *****, you cannot read this. I do not even know if you can read honestly, and you probably will not understand what is going on at all. Autism sucks, huh? I would not really know, because I do not have it. Anyways, you can have my lightsabers, and my Spiderman pop-out painting thing. And my iPad, if you want. But you have to share it with ******. I love you. All my coworkers, I am sorry if I made everything about myself. I am also sorry if I made any of you uncomfortable, or if I overshared a lot. I did not really know how to cope with things (obviously, since I am dead now), and talking about it helped me process things in a way. You are all really nice (well, most of you. Some of you really frustrated me), and I hope you go on to find good jobs and live good lives. I considered a few of you really good friends, though I doubt you thought the same of me. Cinnamon, Laura, and Ella, I am even making a paragraph for you, even though you are animals and cannot read. I loved all three of you very much, and I loved spending time with you. This much is obvious, but Cinnamon was my favorite. That does not mean I loved the other two any less. I hope you three receive plenty of love now that I am gone, as well as belly rubs and scratches in your favorite places. I do not know what else to write. I was a really selfish person. Honestly, I was also kind of an asshole. I do not know why, its hard to explain, but I just was. I know my parents will be angry when I say this, but life was not great for me. Yeah, I lived in a good home (though it was really passive aggressive a lot of the time, and I never felt like my emotions and opinions were respected), but life is not good when you cannot feel much, and when you do feel it is not good. I just cannot keep living life where I am suffering in silence (was I silent about it though? I do not know. I am not that self-aware). My emotions did not really work right, I have nearly acted on a LOT of intrusive thoughts, and I often made things about myself when they had nothing to do with me. I guess that came from me feeling left out of things when I lived in Oregon. Speaking of Oregon, MAN that place sucked. Seriously, do not ever go there, whoever is reading this. My opinion may be biased, as I was sexually and mentally/emotionally abused from the beginning of 7th grade to halfway through 9th grade by this group of people who I considered to be friends, even though they never were. 0/10, do not recommend it to anyone. Can you make my funeral (if you hold one) open casket? Also, I want to wear a suit. I cannot really do anything if you put me in a dress, but still do not put me in one. Also, can you have non-binary flag and pansexual flag colors in some places? Maybe put a couple pins on my suit? That would be cool. Also, you can really have any food you want. Its not like Ill be eating it (Is it okay to joke about that? Its dark humor, and idk how many people will appreciate that). Anyone is allowed to come, but make sure to invite my coworkers. Oh, and do not hire a priest. I know you did not want to admit this, but I do not believe in God. Sorry if you think that hurts my soul, and that Ill go to hell, but I do not believe in that. Who are we to say what is real and what is not, when we cannot see it? Oh, and I want ***** ****** to have all my manga. You can donate the rest of my books (unless someone I know wants one), as well as my clothes. ***** can have my anime figures as well. If you want to keep it that long, ****** can have Sheldon (my car). I do not have much of it, but can you donate the money that I do have to The Trevor Project (a charity to help mentally ill LGBTQ teens). It is now 11:33 pm. I do not know when exactly Ill do it, but it will be before anyone wakes up. I was supposed to meet with ****** ******* at 1 tomorrow, but obviously that is not going to happen. Damn, this was two and a half pages. Not including this sentence, it was a total of 1144 words. that is more than my last essay for school was. I am such a coward, are not I?

I am actively not for lifeFuck it I do not want to get betterI do not want to swim. I do not want to float. I do not want meds to numb me and make the stream I am in better. I want to sink.

"I keep getting this feeling or group of feelings every day at the most, it feels like something is squeezing my stomach when I get it. The feeling makes me think things like ""you are not productive anymore you lazy "" you love wasting all your time do not you"" ""you are never going anywhere with your life"" ""you are a walking Todo list"". When I hear those things I usually reply ""I know, I have so many problems"" or ""I should just kill myself and make the problems go away"" or I will just curl up into a ball and cry until I think of something to do. The internal pain I get from this is so strong it feels physical, the fact that I do not know what this is and how to solve it makes the suicidal thots I am getting even worse.

"Hi,I cannot sleep because I miss my dog, so I am writing to keep my mind occupied. Here is a little background about me. I have never been popular with women. I do not know why, but they typically do not find something about me attractive. I am not hideous, and I do not think I am an unattractive person. I treat people with kindness, and I am not socially awkward but for whatever reason, I have never had much luck with women. I have had a few successes with women that did not work out. When I was younger, it did not really bother me because I figured I would eventually meet someone. Now, I am 40 and it is impossible. I had accepted the fact that it was not going to happen a couple of years ago. Sure, I did not want that outcome, but I made peace with it. I have always loved dogs. They are truly are the best creatures on the planet. A couple of years ago, I took my savings that had been saved over several years of working and bought a house. It was a nice comfortable modest house with a nice yard and I adopted a beautiful dog. he is so sweet and loving. He is my best friend. I was still sad about not having a significant other in my life, but hey. I at least had my dog. Then I made the biggest career mistake I have ever made and left a good company for more money (and perceived security) because the economy was not doing well. That job was terrible, and I suffered from depression and anxiety about it. I was unable to find another job that paid well in that city and now I am in one of the largest cities in the country. it is a fine city, but impossible to own an actual single family home with a yard. Everyone lives in apartments and condos. I do not have a problem with it, but the dense urban environment was not good for my young and large dog. He was so used to being able to chase squirrels and run around our yard. He was so happy. I held out home that my company would allow me to work remotely because we had been doing it successfully so I could move back and buy a house for my dog. Sadly, they are going to require us to return to the office, and I knew then that I would not be able to afford a house for my dog. He was really is miserable in my apartment. We went on walks a lot, but there is very minimal green space here and his entire personality changed. He went from being happy all of the time to being sad. I made the difficult decision to rehome him this weekend. he is back in the city we came from with a nice and loving family that has a beautiful house with a yard. He instantly lit up when he saw the yard and took off running and playing. I knew it was the best decision for him, but I miss him so much. He really was the only reason my life is worth living. Not having my dog is not the only reason I am depressed. I have been lonely for a long time, but my dog was literally the only reason I smiled at all. To be honest, I would have probably killed myself had it not been for having him. Now, I find myself in this apartment alone and looking at pictures of my dog playing in my old yard and thinking about what I lost due to my mistake of leaving that job. The hard part is knowing I will never get that back. Because I just recently started this new job, I cannot really leave without screwing up my resume. it is not a bad company. it is actually a good job, but I do not understand why they will not allow me to work remotely. That being said, it is not my company, so it is what it is. I just really miss my dog. He was really the only good thing in my life. I am giving myself 3 months to allow time to hopefully have this feeling pass. I doubt it will because I have struggled with it for years, but I still have some hope that my life might change. Maybe I will meet my dream woman on the subway to work tomorrow? Maybe my company will allow me to work remotely and then my new special someone and I can move, buy a house and have dogs. that is really all I want. it is amazing how even something minor like that seems impossible, but that is all I really want. I will start this week putting my financial affairs in order like a will, etc and try to enjoy the next few months to the extent possible. I have a camping trip with my dogs new family in about a month where I will get to day goodbye to my dog. I truly home something changes in the next few months. What I have learned is that I do not really want to die. I just want a life that I cannot have. And not having that life means my future will be lonely and miserable. Short of something miraculous happening in the next few months, I will be gone. I just hope people will remember me well. I am not perfect, but I hope I am remembered as a nice person that loves animals. Rehomed my dog in preparation.",Suicidal

"Its been awhile since I posted here. Years. I have been having some wild highs since then and occasional lows. I got to a point where I prided myself for the fact that suicide was no longer an option. This year has been insanely rough though. A lot of fucked up things have happened. For a moment I felt like I have finally found a way to maintain myself. Financially, mentally, and physically. I was very healthy, exercising and on top of my obligations. The pandemic slowly stripped away a lot of that, as I was forced to find a new routine, and new work. Met with the same endless cycle I once was.I started getting known through the online gaming through a friend who is found success there. I kind of threw myself into these communities as I was feeling lost and it felt as if they gave me support, and laughs. Fast forward a bit and I end up streaming myself, with a lot of support off the bat.Its been about 5 months now, and I find myself with a very active community who is very loving and supportive of not just myself but all of us. I could not be more proud. My friends are the best. However, as someone who is suffered with depression and suicidal tendencies most of my life I have been feeling quite a lot of pressure to maintain this community. I have been lucky enough to make a living off of it , nothing astronomical but enough to have the freedom of working for myself, which I prioritized as a means to continue growing. Even if I am struggling.The last couple months have been exceptionally difficult though. I have began drinking heavily at times, I mean 5 days a week. I told my moderators about this and explained to them why my schedule has been inconsistent, they responded with love and support and I promised them Id correct it and prioritize what we have built. Its been about 5 days since then, I have not drank at all but I have been feeling mega depressed. Suicidal thoughts keep popping up and I am feeling exhausted all the time. I could not imagine the impact something like that would because not in just my community but the platform itself. I feel very selfish. But no one knows the true extent of what I have went through and why Id want to do this. I do not want to hurt anyone but I have been truly debating driving my car off one of the beautiful cliffs and moving on.

"Since I(31) have been born, I failed in establishing myself successfully in lifes most important factors (at least for my health): work, friendship, and love. Despite learning more than the average student, I always wrote bad grades. I barely passed high school. Beside that I was always mocked in school. I do not recall having one friend. I remember being always nice to people, but somehow, they found me boring. One time I managed to get invited to a new years eve party. When I showed up at the location agreed, nobody was there. I later found out, that they tricked me for fun in to showing up despite they do not want to hang out with me. This is one example of dozens being mocked by my peers.However, I managed to survive school without friends and started motivated into my twenties. I worked my ass off to save up money for college, since its basically impossible to get a good job without a college degree where I live. At 25 I had saved up enough money to finance this. Like in school I could not manage to write good enough exams to stay in college. Within four/five years I failed twice my classes, which led to dropping out of college after five years, since I could not finance it anymore. The only job I could find now, was a minimum wage position. I am doing over hours as a cashier at a fast food chain to make ends meet. This situation drives me insane. I worked many years to save for college to just lost all money I had and get nothing back in return. Besides that and never having many friends, I never experienced the slightest amount of romantical intimacy. Because of that I suffer from a terrific lack in this basic need. The worst thing about this, is knowing that the reason for my chronical rejection. I am just that unattractive. Why: I have basically tried everything to make a date happen over the last decade. I signed up on multiple dating sites, I asked out women directly, I joined single meetups. Nothing worked. Almost every women rejected me. That a woman once showed interest in me, never happened. Like every lack in a need, this lack starts to affect my mental resp. physical health negatively. The longer I have been rejected the more I suffered from symptom of this involuntary celibacy. I suffer from panic attacks, insomnia, depression and so on.And I know these symptoms occur because of this situation because whenever I made a small progress in this need like having a date or being touched in this context by a woman, these symptoms disappeared. Beside the obvious things like sex, kisses or relationships, I miss out all the social encounters within dating, since I am already getting cut off for a date. I never talk to a women, I never get messaged, I can never message a women. Here I am. With nothing and nobody. Poor. Sick. Every women rejects me. I do not know how I should continue living this life without anything of these things. I am going insane. I am basically the man no women wants. How can I accept that? People complained about not being able to date during covid. I am living this Nightmare for 31 years. What should I do mean? When nothing in life turns out right",Suicidal
"I inch closer every single day to ending my life, I hate the thoughts I get in my head. I have proved that I am an awful person and my past haunts me. I am so sorry for those I have hurt in the past, no amount of forgiveness will ever excuse my terrible actions and that is why I feel like there is only one way out. One way to make things right, I cannot live with what I have done and I cannot take it back. Whenever I try to move forward and leave my past behind I cannot, it stops me in my tracks and reminds me that I am still a bad person. To my family, friends and loved ones, I am sorry for the scum that I have become, I am just sorry in general, I cannot change I have tried, I have to kill myself I think its probably the only way. I am sorry",Suicidal
"How am I supposed to explicate something so deep in my brain and thoughts in another language?The solution is to be laconic and concise: I do not find a meaning to life and I do not want to have anything to do with it.I try so hard, really. I am studying to get into university, working out, eating healthy, trying to be useful to society by minding my own business and be kind.But it does not work. there is nothing. Nothing. I wake up every morning with the same question ""why am I doing this? what is forcing me to endure this for years and years?"" A future shitty job to the yoke of someone else that has no respect or care for my person, a potential partner that could never fulfill the intrinsic loneliness of a human being with the only goal to comply with the ""selfish gene"" and carry out our biological function. Then what, am I left to bet if my darwinian fitness is good?Funny enough, getting old and weak is the only thing that I accept. But the chapters in the middle of the novel scare me.I blame my parents every single day for being compliant with our nature, our essence. And I always ask myself ""what goes through the mind of someone that is experiencing what I am experiencing and decide to procreate nevertheless?"" I might be exaggerating but I assert, to the risk of irritating the majority of you, that every human that act like this is a criminal, no different from a thief or a killer.Sometimes I am tempted to stop taking my benzos cold turkey to see if a heart attack can solve my problems, but who knows . . .If you are still reading, sorry. there is no good ending to this convoluted show of words with probably horrible grammar . . .

"Every one of my symptoms is completely real. None of my suffering is faked. In fact, I have not told anyone how bad I am, at most, some know little of it.that is why I feel bad for wanting to ""get attention"". Sometimes I feel like slitting my wrists in front of everyone to make them realize I am not well. I just want to feel that someone is there for me, that someone cares about me. Is this so much to ask? To feel that someone really cares about me? (and I reiterate on the word ""really"").I am in pain, I am falling apart, I cannot take it anymore.Even my family does not care about me!So I repeat: it is TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR A FUCKING HUG?! OR FOR A SINCERE ""are you ok?""?!I am A BAD PERSON FOR WANTING THIS?! Is it wrong to want to attract attention?",Suicidal
"I have always had suicidal ideation, perhaps, since my puberty. My mental health got worse and I finally got diagnosed with bipolar in my freshman year of college. I tried counseling, psychiatric drugs, etc. and none of them seems to help. Yes, they suppress my episodes, but the thoughts of dying never go away.I guess the fact that I got interested in social science in college and got into a study group in that regard, despite studying medicine, does not help either. I guess those school of thoughts saying that ""existence is pain, life is meaningless"" etc. does not do well for a suicidal person, eh? In this regard, damn do I wish I can be a devout Christian like my parents. They seem to hape some sort of hope in God throughout their life. Unfortunately, I just cannot do that.Studying medicine, in regards of my suicidal tendency, is a mixed bag. To some degree, it helps me prevent actually committing suicide. Knowing how painful the process can be, its failure rate, etc. I want to die, you know, and it has to be graceful. I do not want to die in pain, life is already painful. I already tried overdosing myself with benzos and failed, only to end up slurring some personal secrets (ie. my homosexuality, my sex activity, etc.) to my parents which stirrs up our relationship in a bad way. Nevertheless, on the other hand, I keep trying to find a perfect way of committing suicide with the knowledge I know: figuring out drugs' lethal doses, its toxicity characteristics, etc. It definitely does not help.As of now, I am currently under that spiral. I have been trying to find the perfect suicide method on the internet for the past two days. Finding means to die and orchestrating my hypothetical death. Maybe I am on my episode again; I do not know. I quit taking my prescribed drugs and going to psychiatrists for almost a year under my parents' pressure. Moreover, those drugs do not do well for me; the side effects are just unbearable. I am already considering admitting myself to psych ward at this point, but as I am currently escaping from them and have no plan seeing them in the near future, I do not think it would do. Furthermore, my established hatred of psychiatric drugs and what not, to my thoughts, would only make things worse, no?I have no one else to ask for advice. All people I talk to has never really helped. Sure, they do care about me to some extent, but they ended up only wanting to stop me from dying without even addressing what the problem is, which to me is only means of distancing themselves from the liability. Therefore, I would really love to hear your two cents from my story.For mods, I have tried reading this sub's rules and I do not know whether if this post breaks any of them.

I had to grow up with verbally and emotionally abusive parents that should have divorced years ago but never did and in the meantime they dragged everyone down. I hate my mother, she is a narcissistic huge cunt. I despise my dad, he is weak and absent.I hate my aggressive and physically abusive siblings. I absolutely hate hate hate my abusive, manipulative, lying, sadistic ex bf. He taught me the true meaning of the word hate. I hate my life, I hate my awfully scarred body, I hate my chaotic paranoid mind. I go to therapy but I stopped taking meds and I am slowly relapsing. Sometimes I put up a mask and I tried to enjoy life, the only peaceful moments are when I am alone, lost in silent places away from everybody else. I had those moments and I hold on to them, but it is not enough. I want to die, to end my miserable lonely existence. My long distance best friend is the only one who wished me happy birthday, she remembered. Tomorrow I will have to put that fucking smiling mask and live another day if I do not end it now. I am scared, but I have been here before. I made 5 ""official"" suicide attempts so far, and countless times that I was just about to end it but I stopped myself for stupid reasons. I am about to slice my throat open with a long exacto knife.I will always be 22 years old Happy mf birthday to me",Suicidal
"358 days ago I made my last post. And here I am again. If I had known I was going to wind up back in this place, I would have just killed myself back then. It gets better is a lie. It does not get better. Nobody gives a fuck. I am sitting here with a bottle of whiskey and all the pills in my house. I am alone. I am afraid. I hope it does not hurt. I hope it works. I hope there is no hell that is any worse than this life. Fucking adios. If I would have known it was going to end this way, I would have killed myself a year ago.",Suicidal
"I have been in and out of feeling suicidal for a few years. Feeling suicidal as in creating a plan, practicing that plan, waking up most days wanting to go through with it, seeing items and thinking about how I could use them to off myself, and so on. I have spent two years with a therapist going over trauma,anxiety, depression, and everything that goes with it. there is been times that I have felt the light shine through, like I was able to work past the bullshit and experience reality in its real form. But I am once again in the low, and once again, it hurts like a motherfucker. Its worse with each major low and each time I feel like I lose another piece of myself. At this point I feel like a husk of who I once was. No drive, no happiness, no goals, just basking in self loathing. It sucks and its no way to get past what I am feeling, but I am trapped in this mindset. I no longer feel remorse for who I leave behind. I know the pain is immeasurable for those who have to suffer the loss of a loved one, especially from suicide. So much greater than my personal hurt but I am fed up. I am fed up with the person who stares back at me in the mirror. Its pathetic watching myself move through the days. And I think its time that I stop being such a self centered dreamy little fuck and do what I have said I was going to do. there is always the next life to try again Bout done",Suicidal
I have decided against killing myself I just realized I still have a bet with a friend the bet ends in high-school I have not even reached high school yet so I am living for that bet sorry if I scared anyone Sorry for the people who saw my last post,Suicidal
I am 20 year old with some good friends but I am just tired a had a problem with bullying when I was little and that hit me hard but the thing that annoys me the most is like all my friends succeeding in life without even trying like the relationship part without even wanting one and I just feel fucking jealous.. I am just fucking ugly and all I want is to find a person to love..I feel disgusted by myself that I am jealous of my friends and I just want to end it all but I just see my family's faces and I do not want to put them through this.. I feel I am playing my life on hard mode while everyone is on easy mode.. I just cannot do this anymore I am just tired.,Suicidal
I am broke and do not have anyone to go to. but i do not want to leave everything behind should i run away or kill myself,Suicidal
"title says it all. I am not like actively suicidal of anything but I am kind of tired of never being interested anything. I also dislike the idea of having to work my ass off just to survive when I do not even enjoy being here. Id like to try a new place. I do not believe in afterlife, but even if there was a place where Id go after I die, it cannot be any worse than this can it? I am tired of here and Id like to try a new place",Suicidal

"Sorry for the alt but people that still care about me use reddit and I cannot let them find out. My entire life sucks and I cannot take it anymore. Whatever I do, I fuck everything up. Everything I do goes wrong. If I breathe in, some bad thing happens in my environment. Fuck that. My entire life is a failure and I cannot take it any longer. I do not care about anything anymore so I will just leave a note why my entire life sucks. Doubt anyone will read anyway.I am ugly as fuck. I was born too early and I am extremely short. If I eat more than 1 meal a day I gain weight. that is why I am slowly becoming overweight. Even people who pass me on the street call me ugly. I am an adult and my body stopped aging around puberty. Guess how fucking miserable I look. I have not smiled for the last 15 years probably. Most of my friends abandoned me and if I want something from them it is always me to contact them. I do not have any special talents. Had to run away from home to be able to move out. Did wageslave jobs that resulted in permanent back pain and back/bladder issues. Every minute on the toilet is painful as fuck. I spend the entire day in front of my pc and the back pain is so strong that I need extremely strong painkillers that are almost like drugs at this point. When I take them everything feels like I am on a drug trip and I start to enjoy it but I am useless for the rest of the day. Alcohol also makes me feel good but I cannot always afford it. I will never be able to have a relationship anymore because my first boyfriend abused me and locked me in his home, my first girlfriend cheated on me with my ex boyfriend. I cannot even watch porn anymore because PTSD kicks in. Horrible right? And recently I realised that I am trapped in the wrong gender very likely. If I look in the reflection in the mirror I do not feel like it is me. I do not even know what I am at this point. I thought everything would be better if I join uni but I keep fucking up my minor. I am below average in my major and can pull through but my minor fucks me. I failed at least 2 classes each semester and if it would not be for covid I would have already been kicked out. I am now taking a minor class for the third time and I still got 0 points in the mock exam. I fucking suck. I hate myself for going this way. I feel like a fucking retard doing a class three times. And this is supposed to be a freshman class. It will only get harder. My uni however has finally given me the chance to escape this cruel world. I get to study abroad and they pay the tution fee. This is my chance. In 2 months I will fly to a different country, quit all my insurances so you cannot take me back! I will probably cut my veins in a public toilet and die a miserable death. Nobody will find out if I have died because everyone excepts me to be gone for 6 months. My death will never be announced to them because I am in a different country. Because I will burn all my public documents, nobody can identify me. I will be missing in action forever. it is only these 2 last months and after that I am finally free. I just need to pull it off. Just 2 more months and I can finally leave this world forever. do not mind my short rant.",Suicidal
Why do people care so much that I stay alive? I do not want people to care I just want to die. I do not have the strength to commit suicide but I so desperately want to. What the fuck is life? Why cannot I take it? What is existence?,Suicidal

I have decided. I will get about 40 panadol pills to end my pain. I might bring a knife as well to instantly end myself. I am not brave enough for other methods. Probably taking my life on the 11th,Suicidal
I have made promises to stick around but I cannot any more it is too uncomfortable all the time and I ca never breath and I feel like I want to tear myself apart to let some of the hurt out but It dosent work that way. There is only one way that works. I am too tired to carry on. I am not brave enough to write a suicide letter because I domt have the words to say to the people I love anyway. I am not sure why I am writing this. I am not sure I want help or if anyone can help. Probably they cannot. I think I am probably going to try and hang myself,Suicidal
"There has never been anything in my life that does not end in failure. it is been like jumping from one train wreck to another. Honesty tell me, after so many failures, mistakes, whatever is there really anything wrong with just giving up?

"I am going on a end of life journey tomorrow. I am texting every relative in my family this""As most of you may or may not know, I have asperger's and ADD, along with a lot of anxiety and depression. I have tried to live alone, and I have found working a fulltime job in a place I am unfamiliar with to be unbearable. For one, it is incredibly lonely being by myself even if I see family on the weekends to go to bed alone each night. Second, I am so depressed and have so many panic attacks about my predicament that it is getting hard to work a 40-hour-a-week job. Third, the pressure of being responsible for everything in my world with no help is overbearing. So I have decided to reach out to my phone contacts to see if anyone would let me live with them and get a part-time job in the area, and pay what I can for rent. I will wait 72 hours after sending this text to everyone while staying in an undisclosed location. If I do not get any offers, I will open a tank of \[redacted\] inside my car with me in it. If I get found and sent to the hospital, nothing will change - I will simply wait until insurance stops paying for me to be there, buy another tank of nitrogen, and do the same thing I set out to do. I cannot bear to go on. I already have 2 therapists and a psychiatrist - a hospital would be effectively less than that except I would not be able to do anything bad until I got out. I assume I will just either get ignored by everyone, a bunch of people being angry at me, or a bunch of people telling me to stop and trying to tell me how good my life is. All I can say is that unless you have lived with mental illness for a long time it is hard to understand what it is like to suffer mentally every day and live a normal life and I have (obviously) hit my limit. I do not want to see myself lose my job and my condo. I would rather go before all of that happens"" [Trigger warning] Cannot handle life anymore",Suicidal
I am doing it. Who fucking cares anymore. Everyday I lie saying its getting better its getting better. When its not. I do not care anymore. I do not want a future. I do not want to wake up anymore. I want to be a statistic not a person. Fuck it.,Suicidal
9th July 2021 will be my last day alive.Even if you see this nobody can help me I just hate my life too much and this is the only escape. Goodbye all Killing myself,Suicidal
"I first noticed my desire to commit suicide in 3rd grade because my teachers has been severely bullying me (name calling, hair pulling, shoving, humiliation, etc) and nobody wanted to help me. Everybody knew and nobody wanted to help me. My parents said I was being dramatic and did not believe me so I just stopped telling them. Other staff members were complicit in it or joined in on the fun and all i could ever think was that I deserved to be sad because I was ________ or ________, and I deserved to die. Then it just continued like that for the rest of my life. Anytime I was sad it was because I deserved it. But the worst part is I never want to be alone. Everytime I get this way I reach out and almost BEG for help. From my parents, teachers, friends, family, anyone who is supposed to help me and the worst part is they do not listen. It feels like nobody cares because of how often this has been happening. I have been dealing with horrible depressive episodes, disgusting methods of selfharm, and days where I do not sleep or eat because I just want to kill myself since the 3rd fucking grade. I have been this was for almost the majority of my life now and nobody wants to help me because of how long its been. I am scared of myself. I am scared of how alone I am. I am scared of how long its been and how every single episode only gets worse. there is never a time where I feel like this episode was better than the last because it just feels like I am sinking deeper and getting closer and closer to the bottom. I am at a point now where every single problem feels like the end of the world. Even now, my boyfriends been distant lately and every moment he is ignoring me just feels like its pushing me closer and closer to the edge. I have dropped food and spiraled downwards, gotten a 99% instead of a 100%, been in a room that is a little too loud, been inable to order my favorite food, etc; the smallest shit and my mind forces me into this state. I have had it worse, but it feels like my mind is just looking for any excuse for me to end it all. Nobody cares about this. My friends change the subject or demand I be better so we can hang out, my parents think I am faking it for attention for almost a decade now, my relatives do not give a shit about me either way. I cannot bring myself to tell my boyfriend about how bad it is. he is been so supportive of me in the past when I lightly touched on the subject but I cannot bring myself to be vulnerable with him if I am just scared he is going to leave and not care about me anymore or if I am scared I will just be a burden on him. I want to be better so badly. More than anything I want to just be okay and not feel so alone. I am terrified right now because if it keeps getting worse like this I do not know how much longer I will go on. I have dreams and goals. I want to go to college, get married, have children, have a successful career in writing, even normal everyday things like eating my favorite snack, but its so hard to keep going like this. I just want to be happy. I want to feel loved like I was when I was younger. I do not want to feel alone anymore, I just want to be okay. Its only getting worse.",Suicidal
"i did not mean to ghost them, but all i know now is that i can actually never kill myself because it hurts them. it hurts them when i do not talk to them. it hurt me too, but i cannot stop being mentally unwell and exhausted and having my brain plagued with intrusive thoughts and anxiety and depression. i just want to fucking die. I am not happy. i will not be happy for a long time and i really cannot fucking take it. i want to fucking drown. i want to die. i had a dream last night that i got 2 cockatiels as a pets. i brought a new cage for them and put it next to my budgies cage. my mum was enraged, and proceeded to beat the shit out of me abs scream at me. in the dream my friends arrived and watched me get beaten up. as i lost more and more blood they just stood there. one of them intervened after a while but i woke up shortly after, when i died in my dream.i fucking wish that was real. i wish i could see them, i wish i could die. i wish i could die not at my own hands and have them know that. i do not want to traumatise them tho. i feel awful. because i do not want them to suffer, they are amazing people; but i really want to fucking die. i want to suffocate. I am sorry. I am really sorry. WHY cannot I STOP HURTING THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE?",Suicidal
You cannot even post here unless you want to die. This group is fucked up. You would rather have someone post there last bill board of how they are going to instead of a positive message.

"I do not want to die. I just want the pain to stop. Today is our 7 year official dating anniversary and 6 years ago we got engaged. Then on September 10, 2014 we got married. All of these dates hold so much meaning to me. Last night I was pleading with the universe, God, anybody to just stop my heart from beating. I am in so much pain.Tonight he will be spending the night and rest of the weekend at his boyfriends place (he left me for him). I will be here at this big empty house alone.I really do not think I am going to get through this. Today is hard",Suicidal
"I do not think many people saw [my post from earlier this week]( but the tl:dr is: I have been suicidal for a while but especially the last month or so, there is a forest fire raging less than 10 miles from my house, I called the suicide hotline because the fire and the thought of evacuation are making me feel way more ready to actually end myself. The suicide hotline operator told me that she thought I was a prank caller, then implied I should stop calling (because I have called before multiple times), and hung up on me.I thought the fire was bad a few days ago, but its only 2 miles from my house now. The forest service has done nothing to prevent the fire until today, and even right now they will not answer any calls from people in the town, and they only have those bucket-helicopters working and no ground crew (called my aunt who works for the forest service the next town over on the other side of the fire and she filled my family in). They tried to back burn but we do not know how much it helped. there is so much smoke that there were times today you could not even see the sun. I am watching it as I type and I can actually see the trees catching flame from this distance. Its surreal.I have had most of my belongings packed for the last three days in case I really did need to leave, but I am honestly having trouble imagining myself being able to pack up, evacuate, and not kill myself. I was already planning on killing myself at the end of the summer, because ~~I dropped out of college after two semesters and am already going to be stuck in debt until I am dead anyway, and Ill never be able to go back, even if I wanted to. My only source of income will be burned in the fire if my home burns down because its a farm. I am friendless, boyfriendless, I am broke, my family is a mess. I am lonely as hell. I have probably got half a dozen mental problems that I need professional help for, but I am uninsured and broke, and the one therapy session I have gone to she ignored me when I tried to explain my problems and symptoms and just made me answer a mhs questionnaire she read off her computer. And I cannot stop thinking about my boyfriend who killed himself last year.~~ I have got some shitty stuff going on right now and I cannot see myself finding a way out of it besides taking my own life.I cannot wrap my head around the way the suicide hotline operator acted. What the hell did I say or do that made her think my call was disingenuous? Is it because I have called there before? I have before because it really had helped me up to this point to deal with all the horrible things in my life I do not know how to deal with. A few times the calls have felt forced and like the operator was just trying to get me off the line, but for so many of the times I talked to someone it honestly felt like they gave a shit about me, which is something that I do not really think I have felt from the people in my real life in the same amount in a long time.I am trying hard not to feel hurt because that feels like it would be petty and selfish, but... I am hurt for myself, but also strangely worried, I guess. I may still be here three days later but I feel more prepared, willing, and able to kill myself than I ever have before in my life. I even have half of a suicide note drafted for if I have to do it. What would have happened if she had said that to someone who was holding the gun or the rope or the bottle of pills in their hand already? What the hell would have happened to someone who got her when they called in and were maybe just hoping to to talk to someone before they died, and instead got accused of trying to abuse the system for their own amusement and were hung up on?How the hell could someone who works at one of these lines, who are supposed to be trained in talking people down from these urges. How could someone accuse someone who calls in of being a prankster and try to shame them for this perceived attack, then after hearing the caller promise that they were genuinely afraid that they were going to commit suicide and wanted some comfort or help, tell them that they have called too much before, and then hang up. I cannot stop thinking about what would have happened if someone else made that call instead of me.This makes things more complicated, but even though I feel angry, I also feel bad and guilty for feeling angry. These operators are overworked volunteers, and I know they have a script and a time limit, and they cannot actually offer any advice, and a bunch of other things that they can and cannot do. These people are signing up to try to help people but still have a lot of limits and stressors put on them to be able to do so. Their because is noble, even if their methodology is flawed. And I know that they get horrible horrible prank callers and sex callers all the time, so I can understand trying to make sure they are not wasting their time on those who steal it for their own pleasure when real people suffer when they do not get the support they need. I feel terrible for feeling hurt and angry at someone who was probably just trying to do her volunteer job to the best of her abilities. But I just cannot get her voice out of my head, especially now that I am sitting in my field watching the trees go up in flames in naked eyesight, and now that I am trying to think of the fastest and least messy way to kill myself when I leave. I cannot get it out of my head that she, and maybe all the other people who helped me, might have spent most of our calls thinking I was making it up for attention or for a laugh or god forbid for sexual perversion. I know that I cannot call back to them even though I do not know if I know how to deal with this stuff without calling them and asking. All the other times they have helped me feel tainted now, which makes me feel way worse about my problems. I just do not know what to say do think or feel anymore. Update: The Fire Has Gotten Worse",Suicidal
"i know its selfish but its not like i feel alive anymore. It does not really matter if I am dead or alive. I am a perv, a idiot, I am not good at anything, i addicted to porn, i used to be such an asshole, i even bullied ppl before, I am just the lowest of the lowest. Even i have a decent fam, or maybe i have a decent friends and a decent life. i just feel like I am such trash that it will be a better if i just die but i feel like i deserve to feel like shit, to suffer this karma, even if dying is just an excuse to run away for the shit i have done to everyone around me :) what is so wrong bout suiciding",Suicidal
"I was pretty much suicidal consistently since 2016. I went through another breakup recently which again made me spiral. Thankfully there was a therapy session right after. She gave me a lot of pointers on how to tackle my trauma of abandonment and neglect and general feeling of loneliness. And I went through so much shit in the past 2 years in my relationships that this session just woke me up from my slumber. Like I am done feeling this way. I am done giving my energy to people who do not deserve it. For some reason I do not give a damn about relationships anymore and the very thought of it exhausts me and now I finally feel free. Like I finally feel like I can live my life and direct energy to myself and I do not owe anyone anything. I do not have to spend time deliberating if I mean anything to anyone. I do not have to obsess and overthink, like I am over everything. I just do not care and I want to take care of myself and spoil myself and for the first time like I actually want to live!! Like I want to live my life not giving a shit about anyone else or what anyone else thinks of me or being desperate for a relationship or some form of Connection. I am done feeling this way and ever since my therapy I have only felt excited to live my life as a single person and I am so ready !!! Finally leaving this group",Suicidal

"it is pointless. Why I still try to find ways to live? My body is destroyed. My health too. I do not gave a job, I do not have friends I do not have a boyfriend. People think that I am privileged because my parents give me money. I just feel useless.Maybe my problems are not big enough fo others but for me they are. I am a difficult person. Sometimes I think I am better than everyone else, I am getting paranoid that I am special. Other times I just believe that I am a big failure. For sure I am a wasted potential. I do not think it is my fault. I do not care about therapy and yet I am desperate for someone to understand me.I have made my decision. it is does not matter if everyday I try to break my compulsions and find new ways to improve my life and take care of me. Today I permitted to myself to wore a new hair ribbon and I bought a book. But there is no point. Sooner or later I will do what I have to. Finally I will find piece I hope.
